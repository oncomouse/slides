## Robert Heinlein<br><small>(in Boucher's *Rocket to the Morgue*)</small>

> There's just one point about rockets I'd like to venture on my own before we start the demonstration.  I don't know if Hugo agrees with me on this; he probably hasn't even bothered himself about it.  But it's this: That the rocket carries in its zooming path the hopes of all men of good will.  **By leaving the planet, man may become worthy of his dominion over it, and attain dominion over himself.**  The realization that there is something beyond this earth, if only a purely physical sense, may unite this earth, may change men form a horde of wretchedly warring clans to a noble union of mankind.
>
> I may be deluded in my hopes. The discovery of new worlds may be as futile as the discovery of the New World.  It may mean only further imperial wars of conquest, new chapters in the cruel exploitation of subject native races.  But it may mean new unity, new vigor, new humanity, and the realization at last of all that is best in mankind.  I hope so anyway. (192)

## Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek<br><small>"#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO"</small>

> We need to revive the argument that was traditionally made for post-capitalism: not only is capitalism an unjust and perverted system, but it is also a system that holds back progress. Our technological development is being suppressed by capitalism, as much as it has been unleashed. Accelerationism is the basic belief that these capacities can and should be let loose by moving beyond the limitations imposed by capitalist society. The movement towards a surpassing of our current constraints must include more than simply a struggle for a more rational global society. We believe it must also include recovering the dreams which transfixed many from the middle of the Nineteenth Century until the dawn of the neoliberal era, of the quest of Homo Sapiens **towards expansion beyond the limitations of the earth and our immediate bodily forms**. These visions are today viewed as relics of a more innocent moment. Yet they both diagnose the staggering lack of imagination in our own time, and offer the promise of a future that is affectively invigorating, as well as intellectually energising. (361)

## H.P. Lovecraft<br><small>"The Call of Cthulhu"</small>

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day **the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age**.
>
> Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. (167)

## Eugene Thacker<br><small>*Cosmic Pessimism*</small>

> Both moral and metaphysical pessimism point to another kind, a pessimism that is neither subjective nor objective, neither for-us nor in-itself, and instead a pessimism of the world-without-us. We could call this a cosmic pessimism ... but this sounds too majestic, too full of wonder, too much the bitter aftertaste of the Great Beyond. Words falter. And so do ideas. And so we have a cosmic pessimism, a pessimism that is first and last a pessimism about cosmos, about the necessity and possibility of order. The contours of cosmic pessimism are a drastic scaling-up or scaling-down of the human point of view, the unhuman orientation of deep space and deep time, and all of this shadowed by an impasse, a primordial insignificance, the impossibility of ever adequately accounting for one’s relationship to thought… (12-3)

> The fetishisation of **openness, horizontality, and inclusion** of much of today’s ‘radical’ left set the stage for ineffectiveness. Secrecy, verticality, and exclusion all have their place as well in effective political action…

## Jean Baudrillard<br><small><em>The Agony of Power</em></small>

> The Universal is not for everyone. Only discrimination is universal.
>
> In the past, totalitarian powers were the ones who enclosed themselves behind walls (the best historical example being the Berlin Wall) to escape the wave of "democracy." Now these "democracies" are building protective walls to preserve the correct use of freedom from the hordes of immigrants or fantatics. If oppression were only possible behind the Soviet Iron Wall, today, freedom is only possible behind the iron wall of democracy. (105)

## Fredric Jameson<br><small><em>Archaeologies of the Future</em></small>

> I therefore propose a more accessible or visualizable form of this imagined global system, about which we must remember that its novelty as a Utopian mechanism consisted in its non-communicability or antagonism inherent in its component parts, a novelty which had the immediate effect of excluding rhetorics of communication, multiculturalism, and even empire (in the recent sense of Americanization). In this spirit, I propose to think of our autonomous and non-communicating Utopias – which can range from wandering tribes and settled villages all the way to great city-states or regional ecologies – as so many islands: **a Utopian archipelago, islands in the net, a constellation of discontinuous centers, themselves internally decentered**. At once this metaphorical perspective begins to suggest a range of possible analogies, which combine the properties of isolation with those of relationship. For it is indeed as a Utopia of structural relationality that we must grasp the present proposal: "differences without positive terms"... (221)

## Laboria Cuboniks<br><small>"Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation"</small>

> The excess of modesty in feminist agendas of recent decades is not  proportionate to the monstrous complexity of our reality, a reality  crosshatched with fibre-optic cables, radio and microwaves, oil and gas  pipelines, aerial and shipping routes, and the unrelenting, simultaneous  execution of millions of communication protocols with every passing  millisecond.  Systematic thinking and structural analysis have largely fallen  by the wayside in favour of admirable, but insufficient struggles, bound to  fixed localities and fragmented insurrections.  Whilst capitalism is  understood as a complex and ever-expanding totality, many would-be emancipatory anti-capitalist projects remain profoundly fearful of transitioning to the universal, resisting big-picture speculative politics by condemning them as necessarily oppressive vectors.  Such a false guarantee treats universals as absolute, generating a debilitating disjuncture between the thing we seek to depose and the strategies we advance to depose it. (0x05)

## Laboria Cuboniks<br><small>"Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation"</small>

> We ask whether the idiom of 'gender hacking' is extensible into a long-range strategy, a strategy for wetware akin to what hacker culture has already done for software – **constructing an entire universe of free and open source platforms that is the closest thing to a practicable communism many of us have ever seen**.  Without the foolhardy endangerment of lives, can we stitch together the embryonic promises held before us by pharmaceutical 3D printing ('Reactionware'), grassroots telemedical abortion clinics, gender hacktivist and DIY-HRT forums, and so on, to assemble a platform for free and open source medicine?
