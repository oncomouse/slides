>  In its advance form, **capital aims for ever-increasing abstraction and hence seeks to offload that machine for slowing down exchanges that reality might still be said to be**. It therefore sacrifices it and, in the process, sacrifices itself. This is how we pass beyond capital – which played its historical role of domination and alienation to the end, but could go no further and had to give way to a much more radical system of abstraction – digital, electronic, virtual alienation, which rounds off that flight out of materiality we were speaking of – and at the end which the world and the Human have disappeared once and for all. … Humanity is the only species to have invented a mode of disappearance that has nothing to do with the law of nature. Perhaps even an art of disappearance. (43)

## Jean Baudrillard<br><small>*The Agony of Power*</small>

> Take the example of the Web, the Internet, networks, blogs, etc. It is all free, “liberally” deployed without economic constraints, beyond markets, in a frenzy of total communication. This is a virtual catastrophe, the catastrophe of total exchange that is not even protected by money or the market. (44)

> We can no longer match the perfection of our technological devices. What we produce is beyond our imagination and our representation. Humanity, confronted with its own divinized model, with the realization of of its own ideal, collapses. (82)

## Ellen Ullman<br><small>*Close to the Machine*</small>

> The project begins in the programmer’s mind with the beauty of a crystal. I remember the feel of a system at the early stages of programming, when the knowledge I am to represent in code seems lovely in its structuredness. **For a time, the world is a calm, mathematical place. Human and machine seem attuned to a cut-diamond-like state of grace.** Once in my life I tried methamphetamine: that speed high is the only state that approximates the feel of a project at its inception. Yes, I understand. Yes, it can be done. Yes, how straightforward. Oh yes, I *see*.
>
> Then something happens. As the months of coding go on, the irregularities of human thinking start to emerge. You write some code, and suddenly there are dark, unspecified areas. (21)

## Jean Baudrillard<br><small>*Symbolic Exchange and Death*</small>

> **Is there a theory or a practice which is more subversive because it is more aleatory than the system itself, an an indeterminate subversion which would be to the order of the code what the revolution was to the order of political economy? Can we fight DNA?** Certainly not by means of the class struggle. Perhaps simulacra of a higher logical (or illogical) order could be invented: beyond the current order, beyond determinacy and indeterminacy. But would they still be simulacra? Perhaps death and death alone, the reversibility of death, belongs to a higher order of than the code. Only symbolic disorder can bring about an interruption of death. (3–4)

## Paul N. Edwards, "Infrastructure and Modernity"

> Nevertheless, the fact is that mature technological systems—cars, roads, municipal water supplies, sewers, telephones, railroads, weather forecasting, buildings, even computers in the majority of their uses—reside in a naturalized background, as ordinary and unremarkable to us as trees, daylight, and dirt. Our civilizations fundamentally depend on them, yet we notice them mainly when they fail, which they rarely do. They are the connective tissues and the circulatory systems of modernity. In short, these systems have become infrastructures. (185)
