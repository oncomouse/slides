    > In one draft of the scene, after hearing Reverend Barbee's guilt-inflicting sermon, the narrator seeks out Woodridge in a desperate attempt to make sense of the mess that his drive with Norton has created. He finds the literature professor drinking whiskey in his beautifully decorated room and wearing a woman's stocking over his head to maintain his hairstyle. Woodridge alludes repeatedly to rumors of his homosexuality and teases his young student for having the courage to visit him in his room. Sidestepping the narrator's dilemma relating to Mr. Norton, Woodridge dwells on his sexuality asserting that even if the rumors are true it should not surprise anyone if they accept sociological claims labeling the Negro the lady of the races. Falling into a rage he advises the narrator to "forget the books literature, oratory" because in the reality of their society such niceties mean nothing. After exhausting himself with a profanity-laced tirade, Woodridge describes a recurring dream in which he gouges out the eyes of his students who obliviously allow him to execute his gruesome task. As he drops the bleeding eyeballs into a cotton sack chained around his neck, he wishes that at least one of them would feel the pain. By way of explaining his nightmare, he drunkenly declares the protagonist's willful belief in surface meanings a recipe for living without feeling. He then orders his baffled student to leave his rooms.

    >"I wipe my ass with this literature, this condom to abort reality! This dirty shuck literature they drop to soil our hearts and minds. I mean it," he shouted as he turned suddenly to the bookshelf and I could hear a ripping sound as he turned, seized a book from the shelf and ripped out its pages, scattering them about before my shocked eyes.

    > In this quest, for such it soon became, I learned that nothing could go unchallenged; especially that feverish industry dedicated to telling Negroes who and what they are, and which can usually be counted upon to deprive both humanity and culture of their complexity. I had undergone, not too many months before taking the path which led to writing, the humiliation of being taught in a class in sociology at a Negro college (from Park and Burgess, the leading textbook in the field) that Negroes represented the "lady of the races." This contention the Negro instructor passed blandly along to us without even bothering to wash his hands, much less his teeth.

    > Everywhere and always it [the Negro's racial temperament] has been interested rather in expression than in action; interested in life itself rather than in its reconstruction or reformation. The Negro is, by natural disposition, neither an intellectual nor an idealist, like the Jew; nor a brooding introspective, like the East Indian; nor a pioneer and frontiersman, like the Anglo-Saxon. He is primarily an artist, loving life for its own sake. His metier is expression rather than action. He is, so to speak, the _lady_ among the races.

    > [Irving] Howe accused James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison of abandoning the task of the Negro writer. That task Howe proposed to the militant assertion of Negro freedom. In his assault upon Baldwin and Ellison, Howe evoked Richard Wright as the embodiment of the truest, most relevant exponent of black freedom in fiction. Howe, the knowing white boy, praised Wright for his penchant toward what is termed "protest" literature and castigated both Ellison and Baldwin for their failure to carry on the "protest" tradition as exemplified by Wright's _Native Son_.

    > One unfamiliar with what Howe stands for would get the impression that when he looks at a Negro he sees not a human being but an abstract embodiment of living hell. He seems never to have considered that American Negro life (and here he is encouraged by certain Negro "spokesmen") is, for the Negro who must live it, not only a burden (and not always that) but also a _discipline_—just as any human life which has endured so long is a discipline teaching its own insights into the human condition, its own strategies of survival.

    > But for God’s sake, learn to look beneath the surface. Come out of the fog, young man. And remember you don’t have to be a complete fool in order to succeed. Play the game, but don’t believe in it–that much you owe yourself. Even if it lands you in a strait jacket or a padded cell. Play the game, but play it in your own way–part of the time at least. Play the game, but raise the ante, my boy. Learn how it operates, learn how you operate. You might even beat the game.

    > Yet if the only form of tradition, of handing down, consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes, “tradition” should positively be discouraged. We have seen many such simple currents soon lost in the sand; and novelty is better than repetition. Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to anyone who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year; and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence;

    > Which brings me to the most distressing aspect of Howe's thinking: his Northern white liberal version of the white Southern myth of absolute separation of the races. He implies that Negroes can only aspire to contest other Negroes (this at a time when Baldwin has been taking on just about everyone, including Hemingway, Faulkner, and the United States Attorney General!), and must wait for the appearance of a Black Hope before they have the courage to move. Howe is so committed to a sociological vision of society that he apparently cannot see ... that whatever the efficiency of segregation as a socio-political arrangement, it has been far from absolute on the level of _culture_.

    > "Damn what he wants," he said, climbing in the front seat beside me. "Haven't you the sense God gave a dog? We take these white folks where we want them to go, we show them what we want them to see. Don't you know that? I thought you had some sense."

    > Around me the students move with faces frozen in solemn masks, and I seem to hear already the voices mechanically raised in the songs the visitors loved. (Loved? Demanded. Sung? An ultimatum accepted and ritualized, an allegiance recited for the peace it imparted, and for that perhaps loved. Loved as the defeated come to love the symbols of their conquerors. A gesture of acceptance, of terms laid down and reluctantly approved.)"

    > Suddenly I lay shaking with anger. It was no good. I thought of young Emerson. What if he'd lied out of some ulterior motive of his own? Everyone seemed to have some plan for me, and beneath that some more secret plan. What was young Emerson's plan -- and why should it have included me?
