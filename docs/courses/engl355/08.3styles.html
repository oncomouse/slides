## Writing as Presentation of Self

> When hanging out with friends, for instance, you probably talk, act, and dress in ways that differ drastically from those you would adopt in, say, a job interview. We can account for these differences, at least in part, by considering the different purposes and goals you bring to these situations: the different versions of you that you wish to present, and the different ways you hope to define your relationship with the people with whom you are interacting. In this chapter, we apply that same knowledge to writing, using classical rhetoric and its consideration of the three levels of style to get us started. (*PP* 72)

## The Three Styles

1. Low
	* **To Teach**
	* "Plain" (Language does not draw attention)
	* Simple sentences + easy complex sentences
	* Paucity of adjectives
	* Concrete rather than abstract
	* Adjectives / Adverbs judge rather than describe

## The Three Styles: Low

> The best chain saws are formidable and dangerous tools. My brother nearly cut off his arm with one. A neighbor who earns his living in timber just managed to kill the engine on his when he was cutting overhead and a branch snapped the saw back toward him. The chain did not stop running until it had cut through the beak of his cap. He was very solemn when I told him that I had bought my own chain saw, and he gave me a good piece of advice. “The time to worry about a chain saw,” he said, “is when you stop being afraid of it.”
>
> I am cautious. I spend a lot of time sizing up a tree before I fell it. Once it is down, I clear away the surrounding brush before I start cutting it into lengths. That way I will not trip and lose my balance with the saw running. A dull chain and a poorly running saw are dangerous, so I’ve learned to keep mine in good shape and I sharpen the chain each time I use it. (Hubbell 202 qtd in *PP*)

## The Three Styles: Middle

> We are a wandering species, and have been since we reared up on our hind legs and stared at the horizon. Our impulse to wander, to pick up and move when things no longer suit us in our present place, is not an ailment brought on suddenly by industrialization, by science, or by the European hegemony over dark-skinned peoples. It would be naïve to think that Spanish horses corrupted the Plains Indians, tempting a sedentary people to rush about, or that snowmobiles corrupted the Inuit, or that Jeeps corrupted the Aborigines. It would be just as naïve to say that the automobile gave rise to our own restlessness; on the contrary our restlessness gave rise to the automobile, as it led to the bicycle, steamboat, and clipper ship, as it led to the taming of horses, lacing of snowshoes, and carving of dugout canoes. With each invention, a means of moving farther, faster, has answered to a desire that coils in our genes. Mobility is the rule in human history, rootedness the exception. (Sanders, “Settling Down” 84 qtd in *PP*)

## The Three Styles: High

> What happens to us when all the sacred, all the whole is gone—when there is no more whole? There will be only fragments of stories, fragments of culture, fragments of integrity. Even a child standing on the porch in Houston with the rain in his face can look north and know that it is all tied together, that we are the warblers, we are the zonetails, we are the underground river; that it is all holy, and that some of it should not be allowed to disappear, as has so much, and so many of us, already. (“On Willow” 219)

## The Three Styles & Personas

> In terms of performance, the low style involves a writer who poses as a teacher or trainer for an audience who needs to know new information. The middle style stages the writer as a storyteller, dramatist, or comedian, hoping to keep a more leisured audience engaged not only mentally but also emotionally. The high style represents an impassioned author—such as a preacher, prophet, or social reformer—with a message of great seriousness or importance to share with an audience whose attitudes or actions must change to avoid some great disaster or in some way change the world. (*PP* 73)
