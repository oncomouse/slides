## Exercise (From Tuesday)

* You have three example pieces ([here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/whitman.pdf), [here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/nyt.pdf), and [here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/wikipedia.pdf))
* Read them and mark moments that indicate which style being used.
* Discuss in groups what style each uses and why.
* Then we'll talk.

> **Erasmus, *De Copia***: Their attraction is due to their witty imitation of the way people behave, and the hearers give their assent because the truth is set out vividly before their very eyes.

## Fable Example

> **The tortoise and the Hare**
>
>The hare laughed at the tortoise's feet but the tortoise declared, 'I will beat you in a race!' The hare replied, 'Those are just words. Race with me, and you'll see! Who will mark out the track and serve as our umpire?' 'The fox,' replied the tortoise, 'since she is honest and highly intelligent.' When the time for the race had been decided upon, the tortoise did not delay, but immediately took off down the race course. The hare, however, lay down to take a nap, confident in the speed of his feet. Then, when the hare eventually made his way to the finish line, he found that the tortoise had already won.
>
> *The story shows that many people have good natural abilities which are ruined by idleness; on the other hand, sobriety, zeal and perseverance can prevail over indolence.*
