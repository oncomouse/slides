## Ezra Pound

> An “Image” is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time. I use the term “complex” rather in the technical sense employed by the newer psychologists, such as Hart, though we may not agree absolutely in our application.
>
> It is the presentation of such a “complex” instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation; that sense of freedom from time limits and space limits; that sense of sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the greatest works of art.

## Pound, "In a Station of the Metro"

> The apparition of these faces in the crowd;  
> Petals on a wet, black bough.

## Walt Whitman, "So Long"

> Camerado, this is no book,  
> Who touches this touches a man,  
> (Is it night? Are we here together alone?)  
> It is I you hold and who holds you,  
> I spring from the pages into your arms—decease calls me forth.

> O how your fingers drowse me,  
> Your breath falls around me like dew, your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears,  
> I feel immerged from head to foot,  
> Delicious, enough.

## Imagery: Sound

> Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;  
> And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;  
> Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft  
> The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,  
> And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.”
>
> — John Keats, From "To Autumn"

## Imagery: Smell

> She pulled out her old metal cooler and dragged it between the beds [of her hotel room]. She lifted the top and began unpacking plastic containers, and I thought she would never stop. One after the other they came out, each with a dish that traveled well—a salted stewed meat, rolls of Korean-style sushi. I opened a container of radish kimchi and suddenly the room bloomed with its odor, and I reveled in the very peculiar sensation (which perhaps only true kimchi lovers know) of simultaneously drooling and gagging as I breathed it all in. For the next few minutes they watched me eat. I’m not certain that I was even hungry. But after weeks of pork parmigiana and chicken patties and wax beans, I suddenly realized that I had lost all the savor in my life.

> Forgive me  
> they were delicious  
> so sweet  
> and so cold

## Imagery: Kinesthetic

> With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud city from a number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
>
> — Charles Dickens, From *A Tale of Two Cities*

## Images as Narrative

* Images function as vignettes
	* Short stories or examples that condense a single incident
* Concretize abstractions / emotions
* Prove a point more clearly than facts
