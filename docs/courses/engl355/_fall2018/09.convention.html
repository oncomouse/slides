## Convention and Surprise

> Stylistic conventions help writers manage their relationships with readers, placing them in a comfortable frame of mind by meeting previously established expectations. But in many genres of writing, such as the personal essay, readers expect not only to be comforted but also to be surprised occasionally by what the author says and the way it is said. Surprise involves violating, transgressing, or suspending other expectations. (*PP* 38-9)

## What Makes Clear Writing?

## It is Active

* Two Voices in English:
	* Grammatical Voice: "In grammar, the voice of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments (subject, object, etc.)." (*Wikipedia*)
	* Active
	* Passive
* Active Voice
	* When the subject is the active doer of the action of the verb.
	* "The dog chases the ball."
* Passive Voice
	* When the subject is the target of the verb's action.
	* "The ball was chased by the dog."

class: f31px
## It is Active: Why?

> Though passive voice is perfectly grammatical and at times very useful, research has shown that it sometimes requires readers to perform an extra step in comprehending the information. In one study, researchers watched while small business owners tried to make sense of federal tax instructions. They were told to talk aloud while they worked through the instructions. (*PP* 42)

> The downside of this “objective style” is that passive voice obscures who is doing what. (*PP* 42)

## It Flows
> To create prose that flows, you need to write sentences that fit together in a cohesive structure. Cohesion results from overlapping old and new information in each sentence, paragraph, and section of a document. (*PP* 43)
---
class: f28px
## It Flows: Cohesion

* An overlapping, woven pattern with each subject taking up the information presented in the previous predicate.
* A pattern in which a single topic is repeated as the subject in consecutive sentences.
* A pattern that blends the first two.

If we represent each bit of information as a letter in the alphabet (A, B, C, D . . . ), then the patterns will look something like this:

* A—B. B—C. C—D.
* A—B. A—C. A—D.
* A—B. B—C. B—D. (*PP* 44)

## It Flows: Cohesion Example

> The sales team (A) left the St. Louis meeting with many new ideas for promoting the project (B). Wilcox (C) liked the direct mail approach (D). Customers (E) can be located by mailing lists purchased from professional organizations (F). Then we (G) can send them a brochure on the product (H).

> The sales team (A) left the St. Louis meeting with many new ideas for promoting our product (B). Our favorite (B) was the direct mail approach (C). Direct mailing (C) is best for companies like ours that have a good idea of who will buy the product (D). Additional customers (D) can be located by mailing lists purchased from professional organizations (E). These lists (E) will boost the number of people who receive a product brochure (F).

## It Organizes For Emphasis

> Readability improves when you put the most general and most important information in positions of emphasis, where hurried readers will look first, such as the beginning and end of organizational units. (*PP* 45)
---
class: f30px
## It Organizes For Emphasis: Points of Emphasis

* The title
* The abstract or summary at the beginning and list of conclusions at the end of a document (if available)
* Any list or item set off from the rest of the text
* Headings, figure and table lists, and captions (if available)
* The first and last page of every section or chapter (in a long work)
* The first and (less frequently) the last sentence in each paragraph (*PP* 45)

## It Uses Familiar Language

> Using unexplained technical jargon outside the  eld in which people understand it shows disrespect for your audience. The tone you project suggests pomposity and arrogance. Worse yet is the use of merely inflated language—obscure or rarely used words. Why say “rubbish receptacle” when you mean “trash can”? Examples of pompous words substituted for simple ones include *endeavor* rather than *try*, *utilize* rather than *use*, *termination* rather than *end*, and *subsequent to* rather than *after*. (*PP* 47)

## It Is Concise

> The term wordiness can mean many things. It does not refer simply to long passages or ones with a lot of words. Sometimes you need a lot of words. The point is to make your prose economical, getting the most out of every word and phrase, never using more words than what you need to get the message across with the right tone. (*PP* 47)
---
class: f22px
## It Is Concise

* **Cut out pretentious language**. You can usually do without impressive-sounding, pseudo-academic phrases such as *fundamentally*, *it is important to note that* … , *the fact is that* … , or *it is a commonly held assumption that*. …
* **Reduce redundancy**. Planned repetition may be highly effective in oral presentations, but it is quickly overdone in writing. Also avoid redundant pairs of words (*basic and fundamental*, *question and problems*, *hopes and desires*), redundant modifiers (*true facts*, *final outcome*), and redundant categories (*period of time*, *red in color*, *slimy to the touch*)
* **Look for the news in every phrase, sentence, and paragraph**. In a sentence such as “The project is profitable and scientifically valid,” the only important words may be “profitable” and “scientifically valid.” Can you work those into another sentence?
* **Reduce transitional words and phrases**. As long your paragraphs are well structured (moving from old to new information in a woven pattern), you can often eliminate such expressions as *moreover*, *furthermore*, *thus*, and *therefore*. (*PP* 47-8)
