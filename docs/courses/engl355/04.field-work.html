**The Revenge Of Rain-In-The-Face - by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**

In that desolate land and lone,  
Where the Big Horn and Yellowstone  
Roar down their mountain path,  
By their fires the Sioux Chiefs  
Muttered their woes and griefs  
And the menace of their wrath.

"Revenge!" cried Rain-in-the-Face,  
"Revenue upon all the race  
Of the White Chief with yellow hair!"  
And the mountains dark and high  
From their crags re-echoed the cry  
Of his anger and despair.

> "It happens. Friends come in and out of your life like busboys in a restaurant, did you ever consider that? But when I think of that dream, the corpses under the water pulling implacably at my legs, it seems right that it should be that way. Some people drown, that's all. It's not fair, but it happens. Some people drown."

—*Different Seasons* by Stephen King

## Lauren

> From *Mrs. Dalloway* (page 8): "She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on. She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day."

> "Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton."
 
—*The Sun Also Rises*, Ernest Hemingway

.pull-left[It's like I took off my glasses  
And now I can't see the world.  
But they’re pouring me glasses  
And all I see are yours  
You are everywhere.  
You are everywhere  
The road is spinning  
And I can't see the turns  
I don't want to be hurting  
But right now it burns  
Cause you are everywhere

Give me just one more  
So I can fall into forgiveness  
Don't give me my phone  
Or I will call and say I miss this  
But it doesn't matter how many I have  
I can't forget this  
And the music sounds like its just slurs  
But you don't even listen anyway  
Drown me in something strong to get away]

.pull-right[I closed the book  
I ripped out the pages  
I read them so bitterly  
And thought of all that’s wasted  
You are everywhere  
I couldn't bring myself  
To throw away our little story  
Everything but you and me  
Is feeling far too blurry  
You are everywhere]

> "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."

## Armineh

> Taken from Samuel R. Delaney's *Nova*: "Colors sluiced the air with fugal patterns as a shape subsumed the breeze and fell, to form further on, a brighter emerald, a duller amethyst.  Odors flushed the wind with vinegar, snow, ocean, ginger, poppies, rum.  Autumn, ocean, ginger, ocean, autumn; ocean, ocean, the surge of the ocean again, while light foamed in the dimming blue that underlit the Mouse's face.  Electric arpeggios of neo-raga rilled."

> THE WIND TOOK ME. It was warm like the breath of a kind yet wild beast. And it was fragrant from the city’s open night flowers and maybe The Backbone’s blooms, too. When I closed my eyes and inhaled the heady air, I saw the red of roses and the light soft purple of lilacs and hyacinth. In the sunny sky where no skyscrapers reached, I spread my wings and climbed higher.

> "…the scholar is the delegated intellect. In the right state, he is, Man Thinking. In the degenerate state, when he is the victim of society, he tends to become a mere thinker, or, still worse, the parrot of other men's thinking.
>
>In this view of him, as Man Thinking, the theory of his office is contained. *Him nature solicits with all her placid, all her monitory pictures; him the past instructs; him the future invites* [emphasis added].”

> We make art because we like art. We are drawn to certain kinds of work because we are inspired by people doing that work. All fiction, in fact, is fan fiction.
>
>The best advice is not to write what you know, it is to write what you like. Write the kind of story you like best. Write the story you want to read. The same principle applies to your life and your career. Whenever you're at a loss for what move to make next, just ask yourself, "What would make a better story?"

— Austin Kleon, *Steal Like an Artist*

The Orange Above

No matter what hive of iron, concrete, circuit and silicon I venture to, there is endless light. When man refuses to enter the realm of dreams he rips the stars from the sky and scatters them upon the ground, to ward off nightmares. But alas he has created his own nightmare, for above the heads of scores of undreamers, still festers the great orange wound of Heaven. Few children of man venture out into the dark country to stare into the eyes of God and dream again.

Light Pollution is bad for star gazing

The thing I really hate about living in cities is the light pollution at night. Nothing ruins an evening stroll like looking up and seeing a sky of vomit orange instead of the stars. I’m glad I can still visit my folks out in the country, where I can still see the Milky Way’s Spiral arm on a clear night. It really gets my creative juices flowing.

## Audra

> “Lolita…Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita…Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble- winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.” 

― Vladimir Nabokov, *Lolita*

1. “We cannot change unless we survive, but we will not survive unless we change. “
2. “The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be ignited.” (Plutarch)
3. “It is only through drama that rhetoric lives, and it is only when rhetoric lives that we challenge ourselves and others to make a better world.” (Nathan Crick)
4. “You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.” (Pirsig)
