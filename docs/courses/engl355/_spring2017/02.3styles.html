## From Style to Worldview

> In the hands of a skilled stylist, these conjunctions help shape and filter the experiences that writer is describing. More specifically, writers who favor a more coordinate style present the world as a stream of loosely connected events, leaving it up to readers to figure out how those events relate to one another (in some cases, the point may be that there are no connections; only ones that we impose). Writers favoring a more subordinate style, by contrast, play a more active role in interpreting events, making the relationships among them explicit. (*PP* 21)

## Stylistic Worldview Examples

> One hot evening in Padua they carried him up to the roof and he could look out over the top of the town. (Ernest Hemingway)

> While my father and uncles and grandfather watched the storm, my mother herded my brother and me down the stairs where, in a little room at the bottom, my grandmother and aunts and cousins sat quietly in the light of a kerosene lamp, their shadows thrown large on the wall. (Paul Crenshaw)

## Style & Content

> Beams of light slipped in through the slats, illuminating sides of goat hanging from hooks on the back wall. Hosts of flies jumped from the meat to us and back again. A man with a cleaver stopped hacking away at a beef carcass long enough to hear Malek order three skewers. The flies landed. He started hacking again. The flies took off. (Ted Conover)

## Comedic Devices / Expectations

## Comedic Devices / Expectations

Kenneth Burke:  “Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter”

> A skillful comedian could coax a laugh with tiny indicators such as a vocal tic (Bob Hope's "But I wanna tell ya") or even a slight body shift. Jack E. Leonard used to punctuate jokes by slapping his stomach with his hand. One night, watching him on "The Tonight Show," I noticed that several of his punch lines had been unintelligible, and the audience had actually laughed at nothing but the cue of his hand slap.
>
>These notions stayed with me until they formed an idea that revolutionized my comic direction: What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? ([Steve Martin](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140/))

## Writing as Presentation of Self

> When hanging out with friends, for instance, you probably talk, act, and dress in ways that differ drastically from those you would adopt in, say, a job interview. We can account for these differences, at least in part, by considering the different purposes and goals you bring to these situations: the different versions of you that you wish to present, and the different ways you hope to define your relationship with the people with whom you are interacting. In this chapter, we apply that same knowledge to writing, using classical rhetoric and its consideration of the three levels of style to get us started. (*PP* 72)

## The Three Styles

1. Low
1. Middle
1. High

class: f32px
## The Three Styles

1. Low
	* **To Teach**
	* "Plain" (Language does not draw attention)
	* Simple sentences + easy complex sentences
	* Paucity of adjectives
	* Concrete rather than abstract
	* Adjectives / Adverbs judge rather than describe
1. Middle
1. High

## The Three Styles: Low

> The best chain saws are formidable and dangerous tools. My brother nearly cut off his arm with one. A neighbor who earns his living in timber just managed to kill the engine on his when he was cutting overhead and a branch snapped the saw back toward him. The chain did not stop running until it had cut through the beak of his cap. He was very solemn when I told him that I had bought my own chain saw, and he gave me a good piece of advice. “The time to worry about a chain saw,” he said, “is when you stop being afraid of it.”
>
> I am cautious. I spend a lot of time sizing up a tree before I fell it. Once it is down, I clear away the surrounding brush before I start cutting it into lengths. That way I will not trip and lose my balance with the saw running. A dull chain and a poorly running saw are dangerous, so I’ve learned to keep mine in good shape and I sharpen the chain each time I use it. (Hubbell 202 qtd in *PP*)

## The Three Styles

1. Low
1. Middle
	* **To Delight**
	* More Risky / Creative
	* Break the mind from pure information
	* Engage the audience in the material
	* Challenge them to think
1. High

## The Three Styles: Middle

> We are a wandering species, and have been since we reared up on our hind legs and stared at the horizon. Our impulse to wander, to pick up and move when things no longer suit us in our present place, is not an ailment brought on suddenly by industrialization, by science, or by the European hegemony over dark-skinned peoples. It would be naïve to think that Spanish horses corrupted the Plains Indians, tempting a sedentary people to rush about, or that snowmobiles corrupted the Inuit, or that Jeeps corrupted the Aborigines. It would be just as naïve to say that the automobile gave rise to our own restlessness; on the contrary our restlessness gave rise to the automobile, as it led to the bicycle, steamboat, and clipper ship, as it led to the taming of horses, lacing of snowshoes, and carving of dugout canoes. With each invention, a means of moving farther, faster, has answered to a desire that coils in our genes. Mobility is the rule in human history, rootedness the exception. (Sanders, “Settling Down” 84 qtd in *PP*)

1. Low
1. Middle
1. High
	* **To Move**
	* "Poetic" (Language draws attention)
	* Most complex
	* Repetition, Allusion, Imagery, Abstraction
	* Meant to engage emotions toward action

## The Three Styles: High

> What happens to us when all the sacred, all the whole is gone—when there is no more whole? There will be only fragments of stories, fragments of culture, fragments of integrity. Even a child standing on the porch in Houston with the rain in his face can look north and know that it is all tied together, that we are the warblers, we are the zonetails, we are the underground river; that it is all holy, and that some of it should not be allowed to disappear, as has so much, and so many of us, already. (“On Willow” 219)

## Exercise

* You have three example pieces ([here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/whitman.pdf), [here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/nyt.pdf), and [here](http://andrew.pilsch.com/courses/engl355spr2017/examples/3styles/wikipedia.pdf))
* Read them and mark moments that indicate which style being used.
* Discuss in groups what style each uses and why.
* Then we'll talk.
