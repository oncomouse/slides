## Dr. Pilsch

**Blue** "We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far." (HP Lovecraft)

.red[**Red**] "We stand on the far promontory of centuries!... What is the use of looking behind us, since our task is to smash the mysterious portals of the impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We live already in the absolute, since we have already created the eternal omnipresent speed." (FT Marinetti)

**Blue** It wasn’t that I couldn’t live without him, physically I suppose that I could, but his absence surged my mind into an inescapable vortex that dulled any gleam of hope I once had for my future.

.red[**Red**] All at once the scene around me became engrained into my mind with his betrayal becoming more and more obvious at the passing of each second; my heart rate skyrocketed as the blood rushed to my face causing my sweaty palms to make themselves into determined fists, this ends here.

-Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*, ch. 5.

-*Walden*, Henry David Thoreau

.red[**Red**] "That devilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rendering neigh is heard throughout the town, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on Walden shore; that Trojan horse, with a thousand men in his belly, introduced by the mercenary Greeks!"  

-*Walden*, Henry David Thoreau
