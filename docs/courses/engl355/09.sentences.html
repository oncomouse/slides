## Two Styles

From active & stative predication, we get two major styles:

1. **Verbal**—A style in which active predication dominates
1. **Nominal**—A style in which stative predication dominates
	
*Verbal* style dominates in journalism, (most) fiction, and the *narratio* of legal cases. *Nominal* style dominates textbooks and philosophy.

## Abstraction Example

> Someone who wanted a physical/concrete referent for international trade, for example, could be taken to a dock in San Diego, California, to see ships unloading containers full of resin figurines from China. But to talk about the collective activity of *international trade* at all the ports around the world requires an abstract term. Once created, an abstraction can have considerable rhetorical force, like Eisenhower's "military-industrial complex"…(*RS* 151)

## For Tomorrow

As you read "Arson Plus," keep track of the terms we talked about (particularly Hammett's use of subjects, verbs, and subject-verb relationships). Mark **three** moments in the text you think are particularly interesting on these issues and be prepared to discuss why in class tomorrow. Look for moments where tense, mood, or aspect shifts, or interesting subjects are used, or where some aspect of the story is telegraphed by a particular relationship between subject and verb in the sentence.
