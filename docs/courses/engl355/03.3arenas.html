## Levels of Written Prose

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.
---
class: f27px

## Grammar

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.

> As the system of rules by which language functions, grammar allows writers to assemble sequences of words into meaningful combinations: “The cat is on the mat,” but not “Mat the on is cat the.” Children begin internalizing these rules at an early age, and by the time most begin formal schooling, they are able to produce hundreds of utterances that are grammatical. (*PP* 2)

## Levels of Written Prose

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.
* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.
---
class: f27px

## Style

* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.

> The big difference between grammar and style is that while grammar involves compliance, style depends upon a writer’s decision making. Identifying style with choice implies that there are different ways of saying the same thing. To put it more abstractly, it implies that meaning is somehow independent of style, that there are meanings held in the mind or out there somewhere that can be realized in multiple ways. Such a proposition holds only in a general sense and ignores an important fact about language: any change in the manner of expression will have consequences for the meanings expressed. (*PP* 2)

1. After dinner,the senator made a speech.
2. When dinner was over, the senator made a speech.
3. When dinner was over, a speech was made by the senator.
4. The senator delivered a postprandial oration.

## Levels of Written Prose

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.
* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.
* *Performance* – the moment when language goes into action, when the writer puts the stylistic repertoire to use with a rhetorical awareness of audience and context.
---
class: f26px

## Performance

* *Performance* – the moment when language goes into action, when the writer puts the stylistic repertoire to use with a rhetorical awareness of audience and context.

> In discussing how style embodies or defines relationships between people, we are already talking about an important component of performance—that is, how stylistic choice interacts with the people involved in a linguistic exchange. But a full treatment of style as performance requires that we attend to other kinds of interaction as well: not only the interaction between stylistic choice and other people, but also its interaction with other words and verbal patterns and with broader practices and meanings. (*PP* 4)
---
class: f48px

## Three Arenas

* Textual Arena
* Social Arena
* Cultural Arena
---
class: f36px

## Textual Arena – Patterns

> Some patterns are so thoroughly a part of our expectations that we hardly notice them, like the conventional word order of the English sentence (subject-verb-object, as in “the dog chases the cat”). What we do notice are patterns of unusual regularity or patterns that depart from expectations, both of which arrest our attention as we observe words (even parts of words) interact. (*PP* 5)

---
class: f38px
## Textual Arena – Word Choice

Compare:

1. When a tongue of ice flows down a mountain valley, we call it a glacier.
1. She stuck out her tongue at him.

---
class: f37px

## Social Arena – Roles

> … where our interest turns from interactions among words and structures to interactions between writer and readers through those words and structures. Indeed, style is a powerful medium of social interaction. It allows writers to present a self or take on an already established role (storyteller, expert, client, supervisor, journalist, friend, confidant, lover). (*PP* 7)

## Cultural Arena – Rituals of Language

Consider:

* "And here’s what, I swear, immediately went through my head."
* "Through the crowd a sinuous long-haired girl snaked"
---
class: f31px

## Motives? of Style

> Although we feature the term “motive” throughout this chapter, we are not interested in recovering the intent of an author—in fact, we believe that intent is ultimately inaccessible, even to authors themselves. Instead, we survey the various ways writers and analysts explain stylistic behaviors to either themselves or others. Typically, these explanations will name, or at least imply, an orientation toward one of the elements of the rhetorical situation: language, subject matter, writer, or reader. (*PP* 18)

class: f40px
## Motives of Style

* Motives Focused on Language 
	* linguistic convention
---
class: f32px

## Motives Focused on Language

> “the,” “a,” and “an.” Although articles can serve a number of functions, one of their most important is to tag a piece of information as new or already known to readers. Consider these three sentences from Alice Munro’s short story “The Moons of Jupiter”:
> 
> A small screen hung over his head. On the screen a bright jagged line was continually being written. The writing was accompanied by a nervous electronic beeping. (Selected Stories 307)

## Motives Focused on Language II

Opening of Armstrong's *Sounder*:

> The tall man stood at the edge of the porch. The roof sagged from the two rough posts which held it, almost closing the gap between his head and the rafters. The dim light from the cabin window cast long equal shadows from man and posts. A boy stood nearby shivering in the cold October wind. He ran his fingers back and forth over the broad crown of the head of a coon dog named Sounder. (1)
---
class: f28px
## Motives Focused on Language: Coordination

> In the hands of a skilled stylist, these conjunctions help shape and filter the experiences that writer is describing. More specifically, writers who favor a more coordinate style present the world as a stream of loosely connected events, leaving it up to readers to figure out how those events relate to one another (in some cases, the point may be that there are no connections; only ones that we impose). Writers favoring a more subordinate style, by contrast, play a more active role in interpreting events, making the relationships among them explicit. (*PP* 21)

## Coordination Example

> One hot evening in Padua they carried him up to the roof and he could look out over the top of the town. (Ernest Hemingway)

> While my father and uncles and grandfather watched the storm, my mother herded my brother and me down the stairs where, in a little room at the bottom, my grandmother and aunts and cousins sat quietly in the light of a kerosene lamp, their shadows thrown large on the wall. (Paul Crenshaw)

## Motives Focused on Subject Matter

> Beams of light slipped in through the slats, illuminating sides of goat hanging from hooks on the back wall. Hosts of flies jumped from the meat to us and back again. A man with a cleaver stopped hacking away at a beef carcass long enough to hear Malek order three skewers. The flies landed. He started hacking again. The flies took off. (Ted Conover)

## Motives Focused on Writers

> This white from the Savoie region of France, and particularly the village of Abymes, features a crisp, fresh acidity with notes of peach, strawberry and lime. A touch of chalk and river stones so en the acidity, and the wine ends with a mid-finish. … Some will say to pair this with Thai, and I agree, but I think this is a perfect pairing with mac ’n’ cheese! (http:// winegeeks.com/wines/2309)
>
> The nose is just about as perfumed as it gets, with lovely rose petals, lilac and lavender. Add to this a mix of fresh red fruits, licorice and a fr[e]sh pine note and you have a soft and easy-going aroma that I could smell for days. The palate is very fresh and minty, with gobs of fresh black raspberries and cherries. So silky and elegant that it is almost Burgundian in feel, but not without chewy tannins and tingly acidity. Long and lush. Cellaring will reward you, but I know that I would have a hard time waiting. (http:// winegeeks.com/wines/1093)

## Motives Focused on Readers

Kenneth Burke:  “Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter”

> A skillful comedian could coax a laugh with tiny indicators such as a vocal tic (Bob Hope's "But I wanna tell ya") or even a slight body shift. Jack E. Leonard used to punctuate jokes by slapping his stomach with his hand. One night, watching him on "The Tonight Show," I noticed that several of his punch lines had been unintelligible, and the audience had actually laughed at nothing but the cue of his hand slap.
>
>These notions stayed with me until they formed an idea that revolutionized my comic direction: What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? ([Steve Martin](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140/))
