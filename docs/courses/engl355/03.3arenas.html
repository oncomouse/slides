## Imitation Workshop

1. Gather in groups based on which text you imitated.
1. Read each others' imitations.
1. Answer the following questions:
	* What features are imitated?
	* What features are not imitated?
	* How could this imitation be improved?
1. Prepare a brief oral report to the class on features your group identified.

## Levels of Written Prose

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.

class: f27px

## Grammar

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.

> As the system of rules by which language functions, grammar allows writers to assemble sequences of words into meaningful combinations: “The cat is on the mat,” but not “Mat the on is cat the.” Children begin internalizing these rules at an early age, and by the time most begin formal schooling, they are able to produce hundreds of utterances that are grammatical. (*PP* 2)

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.
* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.
---
class: f27px

## Style

* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.

> The big difference between grammar and style is that while grammar involves compliance, style depends upon a writer’s decision making. Identifying style with choice implies that there are different ways of saying the same thing. To put it more abstractly, it implies that meaning is somehow independent of style, that there are meanings held in the mind or out there somewhere that can be realized in multiple ways. Such a proposition holds only in a general sense and ignores an important fact about language: any change in the manner of expression will have consequences for the meanings expressed. (*PP* 2)

1. After dinner,the senator made a speech.
2. When dinner was over, the senator made a speech.
3. When dinner was over, a speech was made by the senator.
4. The senator delivered a postprandial oration.

## Levels of Written Prose

* *Grammar* – the set of rules by which a language functions.
* *Style* – the choices a writer makes within that system.
* *Performance* – the moment when language goes into action, when the writer puts the stylistic repertoire to use with a rhetorical awareness of audience and context.

## Performance

* *Performance* – the moment when language goes into action, when the writer puts the stylistic repertoire to use with a rhetorical awareness of audience and context.

> In discussing how style embodies or defines relationships between people, we are already talking about an important component of performance—that is, how stylistic choice interacts with the people involved in a linguistic exchange. But a full treatment of style as performance requires that we attend to other kinds of interaction as well: not only the interaction between stylistic choice and other people, but also its interaction with other words and verbal patterns and with broader practices and meanings. (*PP* 4)

## Three Arenas

* Textual Arena
* Social Arena
* Cultural Arena

class: f36px

## Textual Arena – Patterns

> Some patterns are so thoroughly a part of our expectations that we hardly notice them, like the conventional word order of the English sentence (subject-verb-object, as in “the dog chases the cat”). What we do notice are patterns of unusual regularity or patterns that depart from expectations, both of which arrest our attention as we observe words (even parts of words) interact. (*PP* 5)

class: f38px
## Textual Arena – Word Choice

Compare:

1. When a tongue of ice flows down a mountain valley, we call it a glacier.
1. She stuck out her tongue at him.

class: f37px

## Social Arena – Roles

> … where our interest turns from interactions among words and structures to interactions between writer and readers through those words and structures. Indeed, style is a powerful medium of social interaction. It allows writers to present a self or take on an already established role (storyteller, expert, client, supervisor, journalist, friend, confidant, lover). (*PP* 7)

## Cultural Arena – Rituals of Language

Consider:

* "Through the crowd a sinuous long-haired girl snaked"
