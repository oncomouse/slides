    ## "Footings"
    
    Book's preferred term:
    
    > The main advantage we argue for footing over voice is that it better communicates the idea that style is always a matter of agreement (or disagreement) between an author and audience, two social entities that stand in some relationship to each other. (*PP* 56)

    ## Voice + Problem of Rhetoric
    
    > But what does it mean? Too often it means little more than “I like it!” In other words, such references to voice can be a cop-out on the part of the teacher. Voice is natural (“It can’t be taught”). It’s something you have to find (“I can’t teach it to you”). It is supposed to emerge from your hands as naturally as your spoken voice emerges from your lungs and larynx and tongue. No doubt, most distinctive styles actually do emerge without a teacher’s intervention—though hardly so “naturally” as the cry of a voice at a baby’s birth—but we would hope that teachers might be able to show a path to achieving distinction rather than merely saying, “Keep practicing, and I’ll tell you when you get there.” (*PP* 57)

    ## Style and/as *kairos*
    
    > The how-to books on style imply that you can revise for readability with no loss of voice; indeed, by meeting the reader’s needs for fluency and speed, you add voice to your writing. But we have our doubts. We have come to think that prose is never absolutely improved by any change. Everything comes at a cost. This outlook can be stated as a general principle, the *law of compensation*, which applies to life in general (see Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay on the topic), but especially to writing: *With every change, something is lost and something is gained*. (*PP* 59)

    ## The Two Faulkners
    
    > [The modern writer] must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid . . . , leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart . . .—love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, and victories without hope and worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands. (qtd in *PP* 59)

    > These days everybody worries about the atom bomb (or terrorism). Every day they wonder, “Will I be blown up?” This fear distracts our young writers from the problems that matter in life, such as love, honor, pity, and pride. Love gives way to lust. Pity disappears, along with compassion. Victories come without honor. Pride is empty egotism. Without the values that these universal themes convey, writing can only fail. It will not appeal to the broadest range of humans and will be confined to mere questions of physical survival. (*PP* 59-60)

    ## From Voice to Footing (Metaphor)
    >But like “voice,” “tone” has its limitations as an analytical tool. Both concepts suggest the spoken voice, the sound of a passage, more than its written qualities…
    >
    >…Footing is a metaphor derived from the physical act of gaining a stable placement of the feet, but when used to describe social interaction, it covers a range of behaviors—from the actual physical stance speakers take with respect to listeners, to the emotions and attitudes they express, to the social roles, languages, and dialects they adopt. (*PP* 61)

    ## Physical Footings
    
    > I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plow through another man’s verbs and adjectives so relentlessly. While he was in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window, and marred the symmetry of my ear.
    >
    > “Ah,” said he, “that is that scoundrel Smith, of the *Moral Volcano*—he was due yesterday.” And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired. Smith dropped, shot in the thigh. The shot spoiled Smith’s aim, who was just taking a second chance, and he crippled a stranger. It was me. Merely a finger shot off. (Twain qtd. in *PP* 63)

    * "In modular arithmetic, a branch of number theory, a number g is a primitive root modulo n if every number a coprime to n is congruent to a power of g modulo n. That is, for every integer a coprime to n, there is an integer k such that gk ≡ a (mod n). Such k is called the index or discrete logarithm of a to the base g modulo n."
