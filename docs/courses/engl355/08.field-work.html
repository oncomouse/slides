## Dr. Pilsch

> Mountains of paper haunt my desk, spectres of unfinished projects and chilling monuments to meetings-gone-by. Or perhaps my desk is not a graveyard but a jungle? The air is humid and oppressively close, the tangles of words a fecund ecosystem of half formed, cryptic, and in-grown ideas. Though the color, neither bone grey nor jungle green, is aggressively, obsessively, assertively beige. It's blandness glows from every surface. The mess, then, becomes my book fortress against an aggressively confrontational non-confrontational space.

> My office is messy. It is also hot. The furniture is very beige. The stacks of books and papers resemble a fort, but who are they protecting? And from what?

>With arches and intricacies so divine, scraping into the bluest of painted skies, La Plaza Mayor holds, within its walls, my fading and distant, yet oh so vivid memories. Below are the stones I walked so frequently, covered in trails that are still unfinished, and surrounded by the smells of fresh cut leather mixed (somehow perfectly) with gelato. And the clock. El reloj. Where we would gather to share thoughts and stories, clothed with the sweaty gift of the summer sun. I can trace the corridors with my eyes closed—yes, past the ATM with the best exchange rate. When you hear the grunts of the homeless, legless hombre, you are almost there. Enter. The sky is painfully, yet beautifully bright. Ding, ding. It’s the clock. Shall I rescue myself from the heat with a sangria or a cerveza? Left or right? Don’t trip on the tables taking over the center of the plaza. Why are all the people here? Oh yes, it’s the Euro Cup. I open my eyes. The game is over. Portugal won. My cerveza is gone. Night is on shift now. The corridors are empty. But the clock persists.

>The Plaza Mayor is one of the prettiest and oldest architectural structures of Salamanca. If you are trying to get to the Plaza Mayor from the north of town, you will walk south down La Calle de Zamora. You will pass the Deutche Bank on your right, and several homeless men asking for your money. It’s very hot during the summer days, but there are many shops where you can order a gelato or sit down and have a drink. Upon arriving at the Plaza Mayor, you will be underneath a giant clock. The clock will ring once every quarter hour and several times on the hour, so don’t be alarmed. Many tourist groups and friends will make plans to meet there, so if you want to walk with a group through town, a good starting position and reference point is directly under this clock. If you continue into the center of the plaza, there will be many tables for patrons at the surrounding restaurants. You can only sit down there if you intend to buy something. I would suggest joining the crowds during the soccer games because it is very exciting, and there are deals on the already very cheap beers and sangrias. Don’t forget to do some shopping while you’re in the plaza! There are some great souvenir locations as well as places to get authentic Spanish leather. Although it’s almost always busy, the plaza will finally shut down around 3 am, at which point the lights will go off, but the clock will continue to ring.

> The Guadalupe greets me with gurgles as it bears itself toward Not Here. It wriggles constantly, fidgeting as the minnows flicker through patches of sunlight, and water bugs play hide and seek between the shadows of the tree branches. If I pick up a stone, I can hear the splash of my own laughter at ten years old when Megan and Jacob tried to teach my clumsy fingers to make the smooth stones walk on water. But even after two, three, even five skips, the river swallowed each stone whole. When Megan died, I ran to the river and wondered how it would feel to dive into the cold water and join those stones that couldn’t fight gravity forever. But humans don’t sink. They float on, borne by the current that goes Anywhere But Here, to refuge, to a place where you don’t always have to think about death. To a place that still whispers the echoes of giggles and childhood games and skipping stones.

## Ava (Low Style)
> The Guadalupe River flows through the city of New Braunfels, Texas. The Guadalupe and Comal rivers are both open for tubing and kayaking during the spring and summer seasons. Many tourists flock to New Braunfels during this period. My mother grew up in New Braunfels, and in seventh grade my grandparents moved to a house on a hilltop that overlooked the Guadalupe River. When my family visited my grandparents, we would always take a trip to the river. It became a kind of family tradition. During the spring and summer, the Guadalupe would have lots of tourists floating along. In the winter and fall, the only floaters would be leaves and broken twigs. I love visiting the river. It allows me to reconnect with nature in a different way.

>  A portal to infinite dimensions. A silent comforter. You share your secrets, your wishes, your fears, your loves, your triumphs, your loses. What you most look forward to and what you most dread. Your days are marked, beginning and end. Soft, cool, calming. It grows, adapts, becomes an expression of your inner self.

> The bed is simple. A standard, black metal frame holds it up. A mattress is placed in the fame and topped with a two inch thick piece of foam to add comfort. These two pieces are covered in a white fitted sheet. A second white sheet is then placed over these, and a personalized comforter is added. Two to four pillows are places at one end for comfort and possibly decoration. Sizes may vary.

## Kamryn (High Style)

> When pitted against the quintessential norms society has placed upon families, my childhood may seem to fall short. But who is this all-knowing, all-encompassing judge who dictates the validity of my version of familial love. The love I know was bred inside four wood-paneled walls that house the two souls I would argue best embody love. Home is a screen door that protects me from the harmful world. The smell of homemade pie that transports me to a time of child-like wonder. A mahogany colored rocking chair that seems to rid my wondering mind of all anxieties. The record player crackles dimly in background, playing a tune reminiscent of the better days. As the sun illuminates the room, laughter begins to fill the air. A swift glance out of blinds, dimmed by the sun, reveals a grandiose rose tree which eloquently portrays the guidance that pours out of its caretaker. The teal accented exterior greets me with an exuberant welcome; one that leads to joy, but sorrow when it’s time to part. This is love. Home. Contentment.

> My maternal grandparents live in a one-story house in a suburb just north of Houston, Texas. They moved into the house in 1975. The exterior of the house is white with accents of teal. There are flowers planted around the walkway, and a large rose tree in the yard. Inside the house there are wood-paneled walls in the living room, as well as carpet throughout most of the house. The kitchen has a flower design on the wallpaper and laminate flooring. The house is traditionally decorated with knick-knacks and mementos scattered throughout.

> Pictures hung haphazardly along the wall. Seemingly happy faces and matching outfits and forced photo shoots. All these lead down a hall, down a hall to a room. Dolls, stuffed animals, diaries… They engulf me in a childhood now lost. Only memories remain.
>
> There are pictures hung down the hallway of my childhood home. These are our family portraits. I remember my mom making us all dress up in matching outfits each year. Down the hallway is my room. Going back there makes me feel really nostalgic because of all of the old toys lying around.

.pull-left[
The grout on the tile is stained  
Despite the number of times  
It has been scrubbed clean.  
The dirt persists like the memories  
I can’t shut out.

The tile is is cool, smooth, and white,  
Except for the places in the corners  
Where it is chipped and cracked.  
I know the tile is cool  
Because it is always cool.
 

Day and night I have laid  
With my arms wrapped about myself,  
A burning cheek pressed to the cool tile.  
The coolness is soothing, persistent.  
Persistent like the memories  
I can’t shut out.
]

.pull-right[
The toilet in the center  
Is white and ceramic,  
Old and clean.  
It lurches when you sit,  
Or lean up against it,  
And then falls back  
To its original place,  
Resting with  
A clunk.

The clunk of the toilet  
Is one I have heard  
Thousands of times.  
Clunk, Clunk,  
Clunk.  
It serves as a reminder  
Of sick nights,  
Invalid days,  
Vomit and blood.
]

.pull-righter[
Clunk, Clunk,  
Clunk.  
A simple sound  
That has become  
Heavy on my mind.  
A persistent memory  
That can’t be shut out.

> The bathroom is small. The tile, toilet, and walls are all white. Everything in the room has been scrubbed clean. Even so, the grout is stained, and the cold tile is cracked in some places. The toilet is in the center of the room. It is rickety, and moves when you go to sit on it.

> “Let the memory live again!” The hallowed walls stand vertical under the weight of those who came before. Souls of countless captains, nuns, cats, French revolutionaries, Sondheimian heroes, and many, many more linger in the lobby, the box office, the theatre itself. They hover reverently at the mural which depicts their glory and their legacy of the show they took the stage in: *The Sound of Music*, *Fiddler on the Roof*, *Cats*, *Little Women*, and *The Producers*. As those in this mortal world enter the theatre and see these murals, the souls rejoice! For their glory is revisited and remembered once more. They sing entire choruses of “Let the memory live again!” They resound with the joy they delivered to audiences once. They smile at the children who, in the circle of life, audition and take the stage after them. However, one stands tall above the rest: Randy Wilson. The beloved Bryan-veteran, Broadway-actor, turned-Broadway veteran and director. He lingers on the shows that he took part in: *Man of La Mancha* and *Sweeney Todd*.
>
> And those who enter, and those who knew him, remember. They hear his laugh bellowing through the auditorium and backstage. They see his daffodil-colored car in all its glory sitting at the entrance to his theatre. They remember the Whataburger goblets that decorated his directing area eternally. He lives on. “Let the memory live again!”

> The Theatre Company in Bryan sits at the back of the Tejas Shopping Center behind Joann’s Fabric Store. It used to be a movie theatre. Now, it is a smaller performance center, as theatres go, with the entrance facing east. The three sets of double doors open on the lobby, newly painted black. The box office is not open, as it is after-hours, but the chair and Whataburger cup still sit in memoriam to the late Randy Wilson, who died last winter. The theatre seats about 100 people. The backstage is dirty and holds many hairdryers, makeup kits, and bobby pins. Murals of all past shows were painted on the old walls. The *Sweeney Todd* poster once hung at the entrance to backstage, but now it sits folded on a table.

> I spend all of my adolescent summers at a lake house. The house was a beautiful stone house with a bright blue boat house and dock quietly nestled in a cove at Lake Kemp. The entire house was decorated in lake decor. My parents put in a sand volleyball court which made our house the best house to hang out at. We spent all of our hot summer nights out there. Still to this day, I know every cove and island on the lake. This house greatly influenced my childhood memories and my view of the world as a child. 
>
> There is a certain peace associated with bright sun reflecting off the smooth mirror that is a morning lake. The smell of last night's cook out remnants penetrates the crisp morning air. Sand has found its way into every crevice, tracked in by the constant flow of traffic in and out of the house. Quiet snores can be heard throughout the entire house, all worn out from the festivities  that took place. This house is as alive as those that inhabit it and as long as we're living, so does the house.

> The sunlight streams in through the curtainless window panes  
> Little trinkets, polaroids of the past hung by twine   
> A showcase of yourself, who you are  
> Rainy, cold  
> Blistering, humid  
> This was the safe haven, home base  
> The warm blankets curled up, inviting you to forget about class  
> Responsibilities, discarded out of the same curtainless window panes
 
My bedroom has several windows that lack curtains because I like the natural light. For decoration, I have shelves of vintage items that I have collected over the years and polaroids that are hung by twine and tacked to the wall. The room is indicative of my personality and interests which is why I spend a significant portion of my time there, regardless of the weather. My bedroom is so comfortable to me that I have a difficult time leaving my bed to sit in class.

> Tree tops for miles,  
> Pine seeping through the air vents,  
> Burning freshly cut wood.  
> It is good to be home.  
> Crunching, crackling  
> Leaves on the porch, fire place in the den  
> Warm embraces, familiar faces  
> Full heart, full stomach  
> Comfort, laughter, peace  
> It is good to be home

My parents’ house is in the middle of piney woods. In the winter, when you enter their home one will immediately smell pine, burning logs, and a hint of smoke. My parents’ familiar faces bring me joy. They greet me with hugs. My mother is always sure to cook a lot of home cooked meals. I find comfort and peace at their house. It is always good to be home.

## Will (High Style)

The following excerpts are from the book All Tomorrows by C.M. Koseman. The text serves as a great example of middle style as it describes the bizarre twists and turns of Humanity’s future evolution with clinical detail, while retaining a certain profundity to the strange and horrifying events described. This first quote is from the very beginning of the book, describing the human colonization of Mars.

> After millennia of earthbound foreplay, Mankind’s achievements on a noteworthy level began with its political unification and the gradual colonization of Mars. While the technology to colonize this world had existed for some time, political bickering, shifting agendas and the sheer inertia of comfortable, terrestrial usurping had made this step seem more distant than it actually was.

## Will (Low Style)
To contrast this passage, which is fairly normal by sci-fi standards, here is a description of a future offshoot of Humanity called Lopsiders. Bear in mind that these organisms where genetically modified by alien invaders to thrive on high gravity worlds.

> The results of these experiments resembled nightmare sketchings of Bosch, Dali or Picasso. They looked like cripples squashed between sheets of glass. Three out of their four limbs had become paddle-like organs for crawling; only one of their arms remained as spindly tool of manipulation. This singular, wizened limb also doubled as an extra sensor, like the antennae of an insect.
