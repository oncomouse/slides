The hot, muggy air drenches my lungs and I can feel the humidity seep into my clothes and cause my skin to become sticky. The bright sun looms over me as the cicadas scream in the trees drowning out my thoughts. I thirst though I am currently drowning, my lungs filled with the tropical air. I can feel my tacky skin blistering under the sun’s clear-eyed gaze and pray for interference from some tenacious cloud, but the clear blue sky mocks me in its emptiness. My eyes water from the sheer brightness of the world, as I continue on my way to salvation. I feel the dry grass prick and prod my legs as a trudge through the landscape, scattering grasshoppers along the way, the rapid thudding of their wings punctuated by the annoyed rapid clicking as they land. Just a few more steps and I reach my salvation. I open the door and welcome the icy air that rushes to meet me and I truly breathe for the first time in what seems like forever. I rush into the air-conditioned house and shut out the hell I’ve left behind.

Summer feels like country music with the windows rolled down, like the crash of waves over sun-scorched sand, like the familiar laughter of long lost friends.

Summer feels like hello. Nice to meet you. You like that song too? Let’s go get ice cream and talk about home. Home. I don’t want to go home. I’m enjoying our time together exploring this stretch of the earth. It feels like the sun never stops shining here, and even when it is tucked away my world is bright because you are now a part of it. 

It feels like sleeping with the windows open to hear the city. I sleep, and you find a way to appear in my dreams. And when I wake up, I know we get to be together because it is summer, and it feels like a long moment, my favorite moment. My favorite moments. It feels like cheap red wine hitting my tongue with a bitterness I pretend to enjoy. It feels like burning skin and salty beads of sweat spilling down my back, but I would stay here forever if it meant an unending summer of walking this beaten cobblestone path with you. It feels like running. Running to forget that August has an expiration date. But I check the calendar, and it feels like my heart breaking.

It feels like a plane ride home. Home. I don’t want to go home. Summer feels like goodbye.

To fully encompass how summer feels, one must begin with the scorching rays of sunlight blaring down onto sunscreen lathered skin. Ideally, this overbearing Texas sun would reach me as I sit contently aboard a boat while it zips through Lake Conroe. Summer feels like the wind whipping my face and chapping my lips, while the boat causes the white water to splash over my undoubtedly sunburnt skin. As the cool water sprays up onto the boat, it seems to purposefully kiss my skin so that it doesn’t overheat. Summer feels like nausea from the constant swaying of the boat. Summer feels like cravings of juicy watermelon, thirst-quenching lemonade, grilled hamburgers, and flavorful barbecue. Summer feels like side-splitting laughter that causes your mouth to ache from smiling. Summer feels like an exceptionally long, extended weekend with the promise of no responsibilities.

Summer feels like the stickiness of dripping rainbow-colored popsicles on chins, the slickness of sweat as it mingles with sunscreen, the first deep breath of night air as the cicadas begin to sing.

Scorched soles and swollen skin. Sticky asphalt. A bead of sweat snaking down the back.

To some, summer feels like a rush of adrenaline or complete relaxation. For me, however, summer feels like the heat waves that radiate from the pavement as you’re driving down the road. It feels like the mirage of water puddles off in the distance that when you seem to be getting close enough to touch them, they disappear. Summer feels like you’re trapped inside a glass box with the sun beaming from every direction. There is no such thing as fresh air because it is sticky. People are angry and sweaty and even a park bench seems to scream at you as you try to take a seat on its burning metal resting place. Summer is like being baked by the sun, and the only true relief is found by patiently waiting inside for autumn to arrive.

In childhood, the summer is a Holy Time. Much like Saturday, it is an escape from that which limits you. The possibilities are endless in this halcyon age.

In adulthood, the summer is just a hot time. Much like Saturday, it barely means anything anymore. As you age time moves faster.

Summer is the feeling you get when your legs stick to the leather seats on a hot day. Summer is the feeling you get when you take that first sip of lemonade bought from the kids on the street. Summer is the feeling we all get when we are carefree all day, spending time under the sun with the ones we love. Summer feels like happiness.

Another hot, grimy, sweaty day. I would feel upset, but then again it's like this almost all year round. I walk down the busy street, cars speeding past me, honking in the distance. I wonder if they're going a little faster than usual, speeding to get away from this wretched heat. Sweat pouring down my brow, my back... I wonder why I wore jeans as they are now clinging tightly to my hips and legs; and a black shirt couldn't have been a good choice either with the sun beating down especially brutally on my upper half. I think about the cold places in the world, places that are cold right now, even, and I feel an overwhelming desire to get out. As I wipe the sweat from my forehead, I wonder why I even bothered to look nice today--I can feel my hair sticking to the back of my neck. I feel like I'm in an oven, and someone keeps raising the temperature. When I finally reach my building, only a few hundred yards from where I had parked, I open the door and feel the cold AC rushing past me as if trying to escape, to help the poor, unfortunate souls still left in the heat. The cool air is shocking on the beads of sweat all over my body. Great... now I'm complaining about the cold. But I quickly get over that as I peer out the nearest window and watch the heat waves beat down on the pavement. At least I'm not outside.
