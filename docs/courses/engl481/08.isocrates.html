# Isocrates, *Against the Sophists*
---
class: f26px
## Isocrates's Moral Project

> I maintain also that if you compare me with those who profess to turn men to a life of temperance and justice, you will find that my teaching is more true and more profitable than theirs. For they exhort their followers to a kind of virtue and wisdom which is ignored by the rest of the world and is disputed among themselves; I, to a kind which is recognized by all. They, again, are satisfied if through the prestige of their names they can draw a number of pupils into their society; I, you will find, have never invited any person to follow me, but endeavor to persuade the whole state to pursue a policy from which the Athenians will become prosperous themselves, and at the same time deliver the rest of the Hellenes from their present ills. (*Antidosis*, Section 84-85)

## Dangers of Sophistry

> If all those who undertook to teach were willing to speak the truth and not make greater promises than they plan to fulfill, they would not have such a bad reputation among the general public. But as it is now, those who dare to make boasts with too little caution have made it appear that those who choose to take it easy are better advised than those who apply themselves to philosophy. Who would not hate and despise first and foremost those who spend their time in disputes, pretending to seek the truth but attempting from the beginning of their lessons to lie? (Section 1)

## How To Be Good Forever

> I think it clear to all that it is not in our nature to know in advance what is going to happen. We fall so far short of this intelligence that Homer, who enjoys the highest reputation for wisdom, has written that the gods sometimes debate about the future—not because he knows their thoughts but because he wants to show us that this one thing (i.e., knowledge of the future) is impossible for human beings. (Section 2)

## There's the Problem

>  If they were selling some other property for such a small fraction of its worth, they would not dispute that their reasoning is faulty. And although they value all of moral excellence and happiness so little, nevertheless they still claim to be sensible teachers of others. They say they have no need for money, disparaging wealth as “mere silver and gold,” but in their desire for a little profit they almost promise to make their students immortal. (Section 4)

## Doxa vs Episteme

> When private citizens consider all these things and see that those who teach wisdom and impart happiness are themselves in great need and earn little from their students, that they are vigilant about inconsistencies in words but overlook those in actions, and further, that they pretend to know the future but are incapable of saying or advising anything about what should be done at present, and that those who follow their own opinions (*doxai*) live more harmoniously and are more successful than those who claim to have knowledge (*epistēmë*), I think it is reasonable for them to despise such pursuits and to believe them idle and trivial and not a cultivation of the soul. (Section 7-8)

## Political Teachers, Too

> It is not only these teachers who deserve criticism, but also those who offer skills in political speeches. They have no concern for the truth but think that their art (*technē*) consists of attracting as many students as possible by the smallness of their fees and the grand ness of their instruction and of being able to earn something from them. They themselves are so senseless—and they assume others are as well—that they write speeches that are worse than private citizens might improvise, and they promise to make their students such good orators that they will miss none of the possibilities in their cases. They do not attribute any of this power either to the student's experiences or to his native ability, but they say that the science of speeches is like teaching the alphabet. Although they have not investigated how either of these subjects works, they think they will be admired and that their teaching of speeches will appear to be worth more because of their exaggerated promises. They have a poor under standing that it is not those who make bold boasts about arts who make them great, but those who can discover the power there is in each art. (Sections 9-10)

## You Make Us Look Bad

> Rather than gaining great wealth myself, I would have preferred philosophy to have as much power as these people claim it does. Perhaps we would not have been left so far behind and enjoyed only the smallest part of its profits. But since it does not have such power, I wish they would stop talking nonsense. I see insults directed not only against those who are mistaken, but also that all the others who are connected in the same profession are attacked as well. 
 (Section 11)

## Writing Isn't Speaking (*Kairos*)

> I am amazed when I see these men claiming students for themselves; they fail to notice that they are using an ordered art (*tetagmenē technē*) as a model for a creative activity (*poiētikon pragma*). Who besides them-has not seen that while the function of letters is un changing and remains the same, so that we always keep using the same letters for the same sounds, the function of words is entirely opposite. What is said by one person is not useful in a similar way for the next speaker, but that man seems most artful (*technikõtatos*) who both speaks worthily of the subject matter and can discover things to say that are entirely different from what others have said. The great est indication of the difference is that speeches cannot be good un less they reflect the circumstances (*kairoi*), propriety (*to prepon*), and originality, but none of these requirements extends to letters. So those who use such models would much more rightly pay than receive money, because they attempt to teach others although they themselves need much instruction. (Section 12-13)

---
class: f20px
## Practice, Practice, Practice

> Now that I have gone this far, I wish to speak more clearly about these things. I contend that it is not all that difficult to gain a knowledge of the forms (*ideai*) that we use in speaking and composing all speeches, if a person surrenders himself not to those who make easy promises but to those who know something about them.10 But to choose from these the necessary forms for each subject, to mix them with each other and arrange them suitably, and then, not to mistake the circumstances (*kairoi*) but to embellish the entire speech properly with considerations (*enthymēmata*) and to speak the words rhythmically and musically, these things require much study and are the work of a brave and imaginative soul. In addition to having the requisite natural ability, the student must learn the forms (*eidē*) of speeches and practice their uses. The teacher must go through these aspects as precisely as possible, so that nothing teachable is left out, but as for the rest, he must offer himself as a model, so that those who are molded by him and can imitate him will immediately appear more florid and graceful than others. When all these conditions occur together, then those who practice philosophy will achieve success. But if any of the points mentioned is left out, the students will necessarily be worse off in this regard. (Section 16-18)

## Not Moral Education But Moral Training

> Nevertheless, those who wish to follow the prescriptions of my philosophy may be helped more quickly to fair-mindedness than to speechmaking. Let no one think that I mean that a sense of justice is teachable; I contend that there is no sort of art that can convert those who by nature lack virtue to soundness of mind and a sense of justice. But I certainly do think that the study of political speeches can assist in encouraging and training these faculties. 
 (Section 21)
