# Vilém Flusser, *Does Writing Have a Future?*
---
class: f23px
## Bot Poetry

> We would accordingly expect two kinds of poetry in the sense of a language game. On one hand, there will be artificial intelligences that speak, presenting a continuous program of new poems in keeping with their programs. And on the other hand, information designers will, with the help of a permutation game, cause poems—[coded alphabetically or not](https://twitter.com/infinitedeserts)—to light up on our screens before us at a breathtaking pace, like some kind of artificial Eliot or Rilke. […] In light of the unimaginable number of perceptual and experiential models that will flood over society in the form of images and sound, it is doubtful whether language, by then forming no more than a background code, will still be used to model perception and experience. The forces of poetry will then probably be concentrating on nonlinguistic codes, some of them still unknown. Such codes will no longer be read but will have to be decoded in another way. This raises the now unavoidable question of the future of reading. (76)

## Poet as Information Designer

> A poet writing alphabetically directs his lines toward a reader. He constructs an experiential model for people who presumably read to the end before starting to live in accordance with it. That means that the poet who writes alphabetically writes above all in the first instance to critics. The new poet is not facing such an audience. The models he builds are to be received, changed, and sent on. He is playing a permutation game that he received from earlier poets and that he will pass on the future poets. In the future, there will be no criticism in the traditional sense of the word. (76-7)

## Postwriting

> If writing were to be abandoned, packing paper would be the only kind of paper left. Overcome with homesickness, cellulose would withdraw back into its cells, forests would flourish, and reeds would sway in the morning wind, not only on the banks of the Nile but in all the waters of the world. Doesn't this green utopia fill us bookworms, termites who chew through paper, with sheer horror? (95)

## Automatic Memories

> But high-function automatic memories, on the one hand, and green forests, on the other, are for us paper people places to visit, not to live. We inhabit paper, we are used to it, and because it is so familiar, so ordinary, we have made it sacred so as to be able to perceive it at all under cover of its familiarity. *Bible*, for example, comes from the Greek word *byblos*, which is the way the Greeks pronounced *papyrus*. […] Without paper, we would no longer properly be there and so couldn't set out on journeys to the land of green forests and artificial memories. Paper is that substrate that absorbs all knowledge and experience, be it the adventurous new signs of artificial memories or the green blur of the forests. We suspect that whatever cannot be put on paper may not be anything at all. Paper is our home, even if this home threatens to flood over us like a ragtag sea. (96)

## Ritual

> Like everything concerning celebrations, letters follow established rituals. For example, a letter carries a return address (often printed), a so-called date with an indication of the place and the day of completion, the address of the one to whom the letter is directed, and a formal greeting to the addressee. A letter closes with an equally formalized farewell and is signed. Each one of these forms can be justified, for each has a rational function within the goal the letter is pursuing. The same is true of all rituals: Jewish food rituals, for example, can be justified as hygienic measures. But that kind of explanation misses the crucial point, namely, that we are dealing with absurd gestures. The absurdity becomes evident in imagining someone addressing another person orally with "dear sir" or ending a conversation with "best regards." (104)

## Newspapers

> If we regard political freedom as the basis for freedom as such, then we will be horrified to see the newspaper replaced by a cybernetically governed production and distribution of information. If we see in political freedom an ideological veiling of the existential, then the demise of the newspaper presents us with alternatives. When the newspaper, this last remaining vestige of criticism, has disappeared, either centrally positioned senders will program all knowledge, values, and experience, in which case, we will no longer be able to speak of freedom because the world itself would have no meaning, or, when the newspaper—this centrally radiating flyer—has disappeared, we will see a new, networked way of producing information, and it will become meaningful for the first time to speak of existential information. (117)

## Newspapers II

> Newspapers are pages that radiate out from a center. They are structurally fascistic. But within this fascistic structure, freedom of the press (and political freedom) found a voice. The disappearance of the newspaper is beyond question. The question is whether the fascistic structure of the newspaper will be transferred to the new media, possibly strengthened, or whether, with the disappearance of the newspaper, other, netlike circuits will appear. The question concerns freedom. (117)

## Stationary Shops

> Stationary shops are of concern because after the decline of writing, they, too, will disappear from our environment. One might argue that stationary shops should not be singled out from all the others, that all shops are condemned to disappear with the decline of writing. Once information can be called down on screens in private spaces, it will be possible to call down any goods that are still of interest over a cable from central distribution points so that all shops (and the city) will become redundant. But it is different with stationary shops. They will become superfluous as shops, but so will the things they have for sale. The informatic revolution is a political one: we are losing the city (*polis*), and it is a cultural revolution—we are losing the culture of writing. (119)
