## Setting

> SOCRATES: By Hera, it really is a beautiful resting place. The plane tree is tall and very broad; the chaste-tree, high as it is, is wonderfully shady, and since it is in full bloom, the whole place is filled with its fragrance. From under the plane tree the loveliest spring runs with very cool water—our feet cant testify to that. The place appears to be dedicated to Achelous and some of the Nympths, if we can judge from the statues and votive offerings. Feel the freshness of the air; how pretty and pleasant it is; how it echoes with the summery, sweet song of the cicadas' chorus! The most exquisite thing of all, of course, is the grassy slope: it rises so gently that you can rest your head perfectly when you lie down on it. You've really been the most marvelous guide, my dear Phaedrus.
>
> PHAEDRUS: And you, my remarkable friend, appear to be totally out of place. (230b-230c)

## Nature / Self

> SOCRATES: I am devoted to learning; landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me—only the people in the city can do that. (230d)

## Nature / Self

> SOCRATES: I am devoted to learning; landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me—only the people in the city can do that. (230d)

> SOCRATES: I am still unable, as the Delphic inscription orders, to know myself; and it really seems to me ridiculous to look into other things before I have understood that. This is why I do not concern myself with them. I accept what is generally believed, and, as I was just saying, not into them but into my own self ... (229e-230a)

class: f28px

## Doxa

> SOCRATES: … Now I am well aware that none of these ideas can have come from me—I know my own ignorance. The only other possibility, I think, is that I was filled, like an empty jar, by the words of other people streaming in through my ears, though I'm so stupid that I've even forgetten where and from whom I heard them. (235c)

(235c)

> SOCRATES: … Ordinary people cannot see that they do not know the true nature of a particular subject, so they proceed as if they did; and because they do not work out an agreement at the start of the inquiry, they wind up as you would expect (*eikos*)—in conflict with themselves and each other. (237c)

class: f38px
## Ecstasy

> SOCRATES: It's a miracle, my friend; I'm in ecstasy. And it's all your doing, Phaedrus: I was looking at you while you were reading and it seemed to me the speech had made you radiant with delight; and since I believe you understand these matters better than I do, I followed your lead, and following you I shared your Bacchic frenzy (235d)

class: f24px

## Who Speaks?

> SOCRATES: I'll never, as long as Lysias himself is present, allow you to practice your own speechmaking on me. (228e)
---
class: f24px

## Who Speaks?

> SOCRATES: I'll never, as long as Lysias himself is present, allow you to practice your own speechmaking on me. (228e)

> SOCRATES: There's something really divine about this place, so don't be surprised if I'm quite taken by the Nymphs' madness as I go on with my speech. I'm on the edge of speaking in dithyrambs as it is. (238d)

> SOCRATES: My friend, just as I was about to cross the river, the familiar divine sign (*daimonion*) came to me which, whenever it occurs, holds me back from something I am about to do. (242c)
