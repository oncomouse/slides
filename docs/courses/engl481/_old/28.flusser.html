# Vilém Flusser, *Does Writing Have a Future?*

class: f24px
## Script ≠ Play

> One can read *Macbeth* before, after, or entirely independently of a theater production and each time receive a different message. One reads beforehand to visualize the drama. One reads afterwards to determine how much of the text was lost in the drama and how much was added. One reads independently to dedramatize the text. In those rare cases when one reads a script, there is always an awkward feeling of having torn the text out of context, out of the context of a broadcast and out of that of the whole radio station. The text does not stand on its own two feet. Should it be complete in itself, it would be a bad script, one that does not fulfill the requirements the station set for it. Such a comparison of a script to a dramaturgical text shows a more profound change in orientation. We don't live dramatically anymore; rather we live programmatically. (134-5)

## Coded Image Instructions

> Very soon, there will be no further need to approach images in horse-drawn carriages, and scripts will give way to more [functionally coded image instructions](http://edwardtufte.com.s3.amazonaws.com/instructions_IKEA_billy.jpg). Scripts are therefore a double pretence: they pretend that the alphabet is still functioning in image culture when, in fact, they are only using up a raw overstock of alphabet at the last minute, before the whole thing vanishes. (136)

## Digital: Two Words

> As varied as these new things may be, they may be grasped in two watchwords: *relativity* and *quanta*.
>
> The first watchword means that space, once seen as absolute, and time, once seen as clearly elapsing, are nothing more than relationships between observers, which is to say, subjects. And so spacing, the interval, becomes the key issue in epistemology and, in the near future, in perception, feeling, and behavior.
>
> The second watchword means that the world, once seen as solid, is no more than a swarm of tiny particles whirling about at random. And so probability and statistics have become the mathematics best suited to this world. Causes and effects appear only as statistical probabilities. Of course, that revolutionizes our feelings, desires, and behavior. We cannot continue to live as we did before. (141)

## Digitization and Perception

> From this incipient reflection on thinking has come, among other things and above all of them, the informatic revolution. It is a revolution because it turns from its point of departure to the world and to human beings. It no longer starts from solid things (from molecules) but rather from particles like electrons and protons, that is, at the level of thinking. Because it comes from below, it can change solid things, including human beings as bodies, more radically than any previous revolution—to say nothing of the changes it brings to humans as thinking beings. Although this revolution has only begun, it is possible to see a few of its fundamental features already. For example, it enables us to recognize solid objects as mere appearance, not just philosophically, but technically, inevitably making the world of such things less interesting. It further enables us to see particles on a screen, to compute them into images there, inevitably making the world of these particles increasingly more interesting. Third, it enables us to produce machines that think and work automatically, relying on articulated leaps of particles, demanding a reordering of all values bound up with work and thought. And finally, it enables us to analyze and synthesize thought processes from a new point of view, namely, that of informatics, and so we must learn to think differently. (144)

## Translation or Barbarism

> In the matter of recoding, we face tow opposing tendencies. On one hand we have people who don't want to learn to record for they don't believe it is necessary to learn afresh. On the other hand, we have people who approach everything written and yet to be written with the intention of recoding it, either because they sense an adventure or simply because they have begun to be repulsed by all this scribbling. Between these two extremes are some who are simultaneously aware of both the necessity and the difficulty of recoding, that is, relearning. These are the people from whom a theory and philosophy of translation is to be expected. If it is achieved, the transition from the alphabetic into the new culture will become a conscious step beyond current conditions of thought and life. If it is not achieved, a descent into illiterate barbarism is to be feared. (155)

## Happy Last Day of Class!

> We have to go back to kindergarten. We have to get back to the level of those who have not yet learned to read and write. In this kindergarten, we will have to play infantile games with computers, plotters, and similar gadgets. WE must use complex and refined apparatuses, the fruit of a thousand years of intellectual development, for childish purposes. It is a degradation to which we must submit. Young children who share the nursery with us will surpass us in the ease with which they handle the dumb and refined stuff. We try to conceal this reversal of the generation hierarchy with terminological gymnastics. While we're about this boorish nonsense, we don't call ourselves Luddite idiots but rather progressive computer artists. And we try to aggrandize ourselves, to ourselves and to others who go on writing and thinking by the old methods, by writing learned and lofty comments on our nonsense. But it can't fool anyone. What we're doing as we sit before our Minitels, Apples, and Commodores is so primitive that no symposia, workshops, or seminars can cover it up. It is just a caricature of thinking. (157)
