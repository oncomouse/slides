    ## Consider
    
    Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) should arrive within three days after the card. The
    bank currently does not have the software to allow cardholders to personalize their PINs. The
    company selected a four-digit number for your PIN.

    ## Improved
    
    Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) should arrive within three days after the card. Your
    PIN is a four-digit number that the bank has selected for you. Your PIN cannot be personalized
    because the bank currently does not have the software to allow cardholders to personalize their
    PINs.
