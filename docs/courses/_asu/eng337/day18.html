# *The Great Gatsby*

<h2 class="hug">Day 1</h2>

## The Rich

> Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft, where we are hard, cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand.
>
> — F. Scott Fitzgerald, "The Rich Boy"

> It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.

## The War

> I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. 
>

## Tom's War

> "We don't know each other very well, Nick," she said suddenly. "Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."
>
> "I wasn't back from the war."
>
> "That's true." She hesitated. "Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything."
>
> — Chapter 1

## The Roaring Twenties

> Instead of being the warm center of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.
>
> — Chapter 1

## The Eggs

> I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two hugeplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual limitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side,spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion.
>
> ...
>
> Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.

## The Ashes, 1

> About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.
>
> — Chapter 2

## The Ashes, 2

> But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.
> 
> The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.

## Gatsby?

> "Gastby. Somebody told me—"
>
> The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.
>
> "Somebody told me they thought he milled a man once" ...
>
> ... "I don't think it's so much *that*," argued Lucille skeptically; "it's more that he was a German spy during the war." 
>
> One of the men nodded in confirmation.
>
> "I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany," he assured us positively.
>
>"Oh, no," said the first girl, "it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war." As our credibility switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. " You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."
>
> She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
>
> — Chapter 3

## Gatsby!
> "I'm Gatsby," he said suddenly.
>
> "What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon."
>
> "I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host."
>
> He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
>
> — Chapter 3

## Fake Origins
>  The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.
>
> — Chapter 1

> Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn't—at least in my provincial experience I believed they didn't—drift cooly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.
>
> — Chapter 3

---
## Daisy

> "Tom's getting very profound," said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. "He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we—"
>
> "Well, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. "This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things."
>
> "We've got to beat them down," whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
>
> "You out to live in California—" began Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.
>
> "This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are, and—" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.
>
>  — Chapter 1

## Daisy, 2

> "... Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white—"
>
> "Did you give Nick a little heart-to-heart talk on the veranda?" demanded Tom suddenly.
>
> "Did I?" She looked at me. "I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—"
>
> "Don't believe everything you hear, Nick," he advised me.

## Nick

> "Come to lunch some day," he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.
>
> "Where?"
>
> "Anywhere."
>
> "Keep your hands off the lever," snapped the elevator boy.
>
> "I beg your pardon," said Mr. McKee with dignity, "I didn't know I was touching it."
>
> "All right," I agreed, "I'll be glad to."
> 
> ... I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.
>
> "Beauty and the Beast ... Loneliness ... Old Grocery Horse ... Brook'n Bridge ..."
>
> Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning *Tribune,* and waiting for the four o'clock train.
>

## Gatsby

> His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.
>
> —Chapter 3

---
## Longing

> But I didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.
>
> — Chapter 1
---
## Hope

> Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the "creative temperament"—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right in the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
