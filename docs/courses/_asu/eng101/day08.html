### How Do We Fix This Problem?

## How Do We Fix These?

1. The use of lower wind speeds in the dispersion model tends to predict higher ambient concentrations. This is an additional reason to use Northland meteorological data in the dispersion model.
1. The incremental contribution of the emissions to the ambient hydrocarbon contributions would be only 31% of the average annual hydrocarbon concentrations measured by the monitor at the site. This would only occur for a relatively short period of time under the scenario of the "worst case" meteorological conditions.

## How Do We Fix These?

1. RNB is a large, well managed technology company with dedicated people possessing generous amounts of skill and experience. This has been externally validated by our ISO 9000 certifications and SEI level 2 rating.
1. The next recommendation is to clarify the rewards structure. This is required to maintain motivation on projects where many extra hours are required and no overtime policy exists. This can be critical for commitment from employees.

Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) should arrive within three days after the card. The
bank currently does not have the software to allow cardholders to personalize their PINs. The
company selected a four-digit number for your PIN.

## Improved

Your Personal Identification Number (PIN) should arrive within three days after the card. Your
PIN is a four-digit number that the bank has selected for you. Your PIN cannot be personalized
because the bank currently does not have the software to allow cardholders to personalize their
PINs.

## From <br> "[All You Need is Love and Money](https://medium.com/matter/money-all-right-money-money-money-869391578f65)"

> Romantic comedies are about a lot of things: meet-cutes, misunderstandings, rain-soaked declarations of love, pratfalls, sassy and put-upon best friends, steady-but-boring boyfriends who aren’t as compelling as the hero, unexpected run-ins, makeover montages, grand gestures, glamorous careers that leave plenty of time for hijinks, highly detailed speeches about lovable quirks, and sometimes—if we’re lucky—a musical number. At their big, gushy heart, however, they’re about one thing: female wish fulfillment. There’s the wish that the girl and (usually) the boy will overcome the adorable obstacles and fall in love, of course. But there’s also the wish that everyone will look and feel fantastic doing it. In real life, these levels of fantasticness usually cost a lot of money. So how does money function in romantic comedy?

## From <br> "[All You Need is Love and Money](https://medium.com/matter/money-all-right-money-money-money-869391578f65)"

> The wish being fulfilled in these movies isn’t rebooting entirely as a flighty, irresponsible heiress or even determined small business owner, but experiencing the thrill of the accidental run-in, the pain of that first misunderstanding, and the joy of the big, corny “I love you” speech all alongside our credit card debt and career struggles and pull-out futons. The wish is being good enough already.
