**Authorial Voice:** The language, strategies, and decisions an author uses to reflect a particular tone or mood or attitude.

class: middle,big

## Thinking About Voice

> "We are all middle-class," or so it would seem. Our national consciousness, as shaped in large part by the media and our political leadership, provides us with a picture of ourselves as a nation of prosperity and opportunity with an ever expanding middle-class life-style. As a result, our class differences are muted and our collective character is homogenized.
>
> Yet class divisions are real and arguably the most significant factor in determining both our very being in the world and the nature of the society we live in.

## Identify Views of Others & Signal Phrases

Marx and Engels wrote:  “Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other – the bourgeoisie and the proletariat” (10).  If only that were true, things might be more simple.  But in late twentieth-century America, it seems that society is splitting more and more into a plethora of class factions – the working class, the working poor, lower-middle class, upper-middle class, lower uppers, and upper uppers.  I find myself not knowing what class I’m from.

## Identify Views of Others & Signal Phrases

In my days as a newspaper reporter, I once asked a sociology professor what he thought about the reported shrinking of the middle class.  His definition:  if you earn thirty thousand dollars a year working in an assembly plant, come home from work, open a beer and watch the game, you are working class; if you earn twenty thousand dollars a year as a school teacher, come home from work to a glass of white wine and PBS, you are middle class.

## Identify Views of Others & Signal Phrases

How do we define class?  Is it an issue of values, lifestyle, taste?  Is it the kind of work you do, your relationship to the means of production?  Is it a matter of how much money you earn? Are we allowed to choose?  In this land of supposed classlessness, where we don’t have the tradition of English society to keep us in our places, how do we know where we really belong?  The average American will tell you he or she is “middle class.”  I’m sure that’s what my father would tell you.  But I always felt that we were in some no man’s land, suspended between classes, sharing similarities with some and recognizing sharp, exclusionary differences from others.  What class do I come from?  What class am I in now?  As an historian, I seek the answers to these questions in the specificity of my past.
