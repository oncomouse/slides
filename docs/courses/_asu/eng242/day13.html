> And I could do it with you, all right. I know every
one of you, inside and out, by heart. I may have been drunk when I’ve been here
before, but old Hickey could never be so drunk he didn’t have to see through
people. I mean, everyone except himself. And, ﬁnally, he had to see through
himself, too. (_He pauses. They stare at him, bitter, uneasy and fascinated. His
manner changes to deep earnestness._) But here’s the point to get. I swear I’d
never act like I have if I wasn’t absolutely sure it will be worth it to you in the
end, after you’re rid of the damned guilt that makes you lie to yourselves you’re
something you’re not, and the remorse that nags at you and makes you hide
behind lousy pipe dreams about tomorrow.

> Larry – It’s not. Don’t waste your pity. They wouldn’t thank you for it. They
manage to get drunk, by hook or crook, and keep their pipe dreams, and that’s
all they ask of life. I’ve never known more contented men. It isn’t often that men
attain the true goal of their heart’s desire. The same applies to Harry himself and
his two cronies at the far table. He’s so satisﬁed with life he’s never set foot out
of this place since his wife died twenty years ago. He has no need of the outside
world at all. This place has a ﬁne trade from the Market people across the street
and the waterfront workers, so in spite of Harry’s thirst and his generous heart,
he comes out even. He never worries in hard times because there’s always old
friends from the days when he was a jitney Tammany politician, and a friendly
brewery to tide him over.

> **Hickey** – (_Grinning_) Oh, hell, Governor! You don’t think I’d come around here
peddling some brand of temperance bunk, do you? You know me better than
that! Just because I’m through with the stuff don’t mean I’m going Prohibition.
Hell, I’m not that ungrateful! It’s given me too many good times. I feel exactly
the same as I always did. If anyone wants to get drunk, if that’s the only way
they can be happy, and feel at peace with themselves, why the hell shouldn’t
they? They have my full and entire sympathy. I know all about that game
from soup to nuts. I’m the guy that wrote the book. The only reason I’ve quit
is–Well, I ﬁnally had the guts to face myself and throw overboard the damned
lying pipe dream that’d been making me miserable, and do what I had to do for
the happiness of all concerned–and then all at once I found I was at peace with
myself and I didn’t need booze any more. That’s all there was to it.

> **Hickey** – (_quizzically_) Hello, what’s this? I thought you were in the grandstand.
(_then with a simple earnestness, taking a chair by Larry, and putting a hand on
his shoulder_) Listen, Larry, you’re getting me all wrong. Hell, you ought to know
me better. I’ve always been the best-natured slob in the world. Of course, I have
pity. But now I’ve seen the light, it isn’t my old kind of pity– the kind yours is.
It isn’t the kind that lets itself off easy by encouraging some poor guy to go on
kidding himself with a lie–the kind that leaves the poor slob worse oﬀ because it
makes him feel guiltier than ever–the kind that makes his lying hopes nag at
him and reproach him until he’s a rotten skunk in his own eyes. I know all about
that kind of pity. I’ve had a bellyful of it in my time, and it’s all wrong! (with
a salesman’s persuasiveness) No, sir. The kind of pity I feel now is after ﬁnal
results that will really save the poor guy, and make him contented with what he
is, and quit battling himself, and ﬁnd peace for the rest of his life. Oh, I know
how you resent the way I have to show you up to yourself. I don’t blame you. I
know from my own experience it’s bitter medicine, facing yourself in the mirror
with the old false whiskers off. But you forget that, once you’re cured. You’ll be
grateful to me when all at once you ﬁnd you’re able to admit, without feeling
ashamed, that all the grandstand foolosopher bunk and the waiting for the Big
Sleep stuff is a pipe dream. You’ll say to yourself, I’m just an old man who is
