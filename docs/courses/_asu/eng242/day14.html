    * _The Dictionary of American Underworld Lingo_ (1950):
    	1. "Any official or inmate whose promises are not to be relied upon." 
    	1. "One who makes ostentatious gifts of worthless or trivial things."
    
    > the 'iceman,' who started as a ribald joke, takes on a different, deeper and even terrifying meaning and before the end becomes Death itself.

    > As several critics have pointed out, the locale of the play and the prototypes of the bums who appear in it have been taken from the author's own past. The assumption, however, that he has exactly recaptured the sound of their speech may be open to question, and it is my opinion that, while Mr. O'Neill is a superb reporter of behavior and even of processes of thought, the language he uses to convey them is actually non-realistic, being of the conventional dese-dem-dose school of dialect which a certain kind of abstracted literary intelligence, from Richard Harding Davis to Thomas Wolfe, has somewhat arbitrarily decided is the language of the lower depths. It is odd but nevertheless a fact that a writer can often understand perfectly what is being said around him without really hearing the accent of the voice or the structure of the sentence, and I'm afraid this this is particularly true of Mr. O'Neill.

    > To get at the core of reality in _The Iceman_—which is also its artistic, its dramatic core—you have to cut away the rotten fruit of unreality around it. More plainly stated: you have to cut. The play is far too long—not so much in asking that the audience sit there so many hours as on sheer internal grounds. The main story is meant to have suspense but we are suspended so long we forget all about it. One can cut a good many of Larry's speeches since he is forever re-phrasing a pessimism which is by no means hard to understand the first time. One can cut down the speeches of Hugo since they are both too long and too pretentious. It is such a pretentiousness, replete with obvious and unimaginative symbolism, that constitutes the expressionism of the play. Hugo is a literary conception—by Gorky out of Dostoevsky.

    ** Hippolyte Havel**  
    ![Hugo](images/hugo.png)]
    
    > Hugo is a small man in his late fifties. He has a head much too big for his body, a high forehead, crinkly long black hair streaked with gray, a square face with a pug nose, a walrus mustache, black eyes which peer nearsightedly from behind thick-lensed spectacles, tiny hands and feet. He is dressed in threadbare black clothes and his white shirt is frayed at collar and cuffs, but everything about him is fastidiously clean. Even his flowing Windsor tie is neatly tied. There is a foreign atmosphere about him, the stamp of an alien radical, a strong resemblance to the type Anarchist as portrayed, bomb in hand, in newspaper cartoons.

    > What is wrong: the critics, their terminology, or their understanding of their terminology? Perhaps the difficulty lies in the use of an inexact concept as an instrument of criticism. Certainly Bentley and Gibbs cannot be blamed for finding Hugo Kalmar somewhat fantastic, just as they couldn't be blamed finding his prototype Hippolyte Havel somewhat fantastic if they happened to meet him. The fault is not n the judgment, but in the theory of causation. Hugo Kalmar is fantastic not because O'Neill, bedeviled by ideas, was unable to reproduce life, but rather because O'Neill chose to reproduce a variety of life that is inherently grotesque.

    ## Melodrama
    
    * Five Characteristics:
    	1. pathos
    	2. overwrought or heightened emotion
    	3. moral polarization (good vs. evil)
    	4. non-classical narrative structure (e.g., use of extreme coincidence and ‘’deus ex machina’’)
    	5. sensationalism (emphasis on action, violence and thrills)
    * One Character In Every Scene
    * Victorian Melodramas:
    	* Six Stock Characters
    		1. the hero
    		2. the villain
    		3. the heroine
    		4. an aged parent
    		5. a sidekick
    		6. a servant of the aged parent
    	* Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes at the end to ensure the triumph of good over evil.

    ## Tragedy
    
    * Characteristics:
    	1. Single plot thread
    		* A great man (tragic hero) suffers a reversal of fortune.
    		* Not good vs evil, but from good to evil.
    	2. "The change to bad fortune which he undergoes is not due to any moral defect or flaw, but a mistake of some kind."
    		* Virtuous but not good.
    		* Result of a defect or flaw
    		* Ends in hero's death
    	3. Great man may realize some truth about nature of life.
    	4. Catharsis (emotional cleansing) or healing for audience

    ### If Hickey Is Tragic Hero, What of Larry?
    
    > **Larry** – (_in a whisper of horrified pity_) Poor devil! (_A long-forgotten faith returns to him for a moment and he mumbles) God rest his soul in peace. (He opens his eyes–with a bitter self- derision_). Ah, the damned pity–the wrong kind, as Hickey said! Be God, there's no hope! I'll never be a success in the grandstand–or anywhere else! Life is too much for me! I'll be a weak fool looking with pity at the two sides of everything till the day I die! (_with an intense bitter sincerity) May that day come soon! (He pauses startledly, surprised at himself–then with a sardonic grin_).s Be God, I'm the only real convert to death Hickey made here. From the bottom of my coward's heart I mean that now!

    > **Rocky** – (_in amazement_) Jees, he made it! I'd a give yuh fifty to one he'd never–(_He goes to the end of the bar to look through the window–disgustedly_) Aw, he's stopped. I'll bet yuh he's comin' back.
    >
    > **Hickey** – Of course, he's coming back. So are all the others. By tonight they'll all be here again. You dumbbell, that's the whole point.
    
    <hr/>
    
    > **Larry** – (_leans toward him, a comical intensity in his low voice_) Don't mock the faith! Have you no respect for religion, you unregenerate Wop? What's it matter if the truth is that their favoring breeze has the stink of nickel whiskey on its breath, and their sea is a growler of lager and ale, and their ships are long since looted and scuttled and sunk on the bottom? To hell with the truth! As the history of the world proves, the truth has no bearing on anything. It's irrelevant and immaterial, as the lawyers say. The lie of a pipe dream is what gives life to the whole misbegotten mad lot of us, drunk or sober. And that's enough philosophic wisdom to give you for one drink of rot-gut.

    > **Hickey** – Can't you appreciate what you've got, for God's sake? Don't you know you're free now to be yourselves, without having to feel remorse or guilt, or lie to yourselves about reforming tomorrow? Can't you see there is no tomorrow now? You're rid of it forever! You've killed it! You don't have to care a damn about anything any more! You've finally got the game of life licked, don't you see that? (_angrily exhorting_) Then why the hell don't you get pie-eyed and celebrate? Why don't you laugh and sing "Sweet Adeline"?

    > What I've tried to write is a play where at the end you feel you know the souls of the seventeen men and women who appear – **and women who don't appear** – as well as if you'd read a play about each of them. I couldn't condense much without taking a lot of life from some of those people and reducing them to lay figures.

    > **Hickey** – Love always won. She'd make herself kiss me, as if nothing had happened, as if I'd just come home from a business trip. She'd never complain or bawl me out. (_He bursts out in a tone of anguish that has anger and hatred beneath it_) Christ, can you imagine what a guilty skunk she made me feel! If she'd only admitted once she didn't believe any more in her pipe dream that some day I'd behave! But she never would. Evelyn was stubborn as hell. Once she'd set her heart on anything, you couldn't shake her faith that it had to come true–tomorrow! It was the same old story, over and over, for years and years. It kept piling up, inside her and inside me. God, can you picture all I made her suffer, and all the guilt she made me feel, and how I hated myself! If she only hadn't been so damned good–if she'd been the same kind of wife I was a husband.

    > **Hickey** – (_obliviously_) And then I saw I'd always known that was the only possible way to give her peace and free her from the misery of loving me. I saw it meant peace for me, too, knowing she was at peace. I felt as though a ton of guilt was lifted off my mind. I remember I stood by the bed and suddenly I had to laugh. I couldn't help it, and I knew Evelyn would forgive me. I remember I heard myself speaking to her, as if it was something I'd always wanted to say: "Well, you know what you can do with your pipe dream now, you damned bitch!" (_He stops with a horrified start, as if shocked out of a nightmare, as if he couldn't believe he heard what he had just said. He stammers_) No! I never–!</textarea>
