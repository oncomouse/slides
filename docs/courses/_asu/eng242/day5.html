## Jack London's Credo

I would rather be ashes than dust!

I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.

I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.

The function of man is to live, not to exist.

I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.

I shall use my time.

## Becoming Food

> He awoke once and saw in front of him, not a dozen feet away, a big grey wolf, one of the largest of the pack.  And even as he looked, the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog, yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye, as if, in truth, he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten.
>
> This certitude was shown by the whole pack.  Fully a score he could count, staring hungrily at him or calmly sleeping in the snow.  They reminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting permission to begin to eat.  And he was the food they were to eat!  He wondered how and when the meal would begin.

.topic[Humans & Wolves]

## Darwin's Influence

> But the situation of the pack was desperate.  It was lean with long-standing hunger.  It ran below its ordinary speed.  At the rear limped the weak members, the very young and the very old.  At the front were the strongest.  Yet all were more like skeletons than full-bodied wolves.  
>
> — "II.I The Battle of the Fangs"

> And all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled.  She was made glad in vague ways by the battle, for this was the love-making of the Wild, the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died.  To those that survived it was not tragedy, but realisation and achievement.

## Man as God

> The months went by, binding stronger and stronger the covenant between dog and man.  This was the ancient covenant that the first wolf that came in from the Wild entered into with man.  And, like all succeeding wolves and wild dogs that had done likewise, White Fang worked the covenant out for himself.  The terms were simple.  For the possession of a flesh-and-blood god, he exchanged his own liberty.  Food and fire, protection and companionship, were some of the things he received from the god.  In return, he guarded the god’s property, defended his body, worked for him, and obeyed him.

.topic[Realism & The Wolf]

## Realism's Social Conscience

> White Fang grew stronger, heavier, and more compact, while his character was developing along the lines laid down by his heredity and his environment.  His heredity was a life-stuff that may be likened to clay.  It possessed many possibilities, was capable of being moulded into many different forms.  Environment served to model the clay, to give it a particular form.  Thus, had White Fang never come in to the fires of man, the Wild would have moulded him into a true wolf.  But the gods had given him a different environment, and he was moulded into a dog that was rather wolfish, but that was a dog and not a wolf.
>
> And so, according to the clay of his nature and the pressure of his surroundings, his character was being moulded into a certain particular shape.  There was no escaping it.  He was becoming more morose, more uncompanionable, more solitary, more ferocious; while the dogs were learning more and more that it was better to be at peace with him than at war, and Grey Beaver was coming to prize him more greatly with the passage of each day.

.topic[Animal Instinct]

## Thought & Instinct

> In fact, the grey cub was not given to thinking—at least, to the kind of thinking customary of men.  His brain worked in dim ways.  Yet his conclusions were as sharp and distinct as those achieved by men.  He had a method of accepting things, without questioning the why and wherefore.  In reality, this was the act of classification.  He was never disturbed over why a thing happened.  How it happened was sufficient for him.  Thus, when he had bumped his nose on the back-wall a few times, he accepted that he would not disappear into walls.  In the same way he accepted that his father could disappear into walls.  But he was not in the least disturbed by desire to find out the reason for the difference between his father and himself.  Logic and physics were no part of his mental make-up.

.topic[Animal Instinct]

## Parenting

> His mate looked at him anxiously.  Every little while she emitted a low growl, and at times, when it seemed to her he approached too near, the growl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl.  Of her own experience she had no memory of the thing happening; but in her instinct, which was the experience of all the mothers of wolves, there lurked a memory of fathers that had eaten their new-born and helpless progeny.  It manifested itself as a fear strong within her, that made her prevent One Eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered.
>
> But there was no danger.  Old One Eye was feeling the urge of an impulse, that was, in turn, an instinct that had come down to him from all the fathers of wolves.  He did not question it, nor puzzle over it.  It was there, in the fibre of his being; and it was the most natural thing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his new-born family and by trotting out and away on the meat-trail whereby he lived.
