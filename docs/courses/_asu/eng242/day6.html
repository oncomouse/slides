> It was at Fort Yukon that White Fang saw his first white men.  As compared with the Indians he had known, they were to him another race of beings, a race of superior gods.  They impressed him as possessing superior power, and it is on power that godhead rests.  White Fang did not reason it out, did not in his mind make the sharp generalisation that the white gods were more powerful.  It was a feeling, nothing more, and yet none the less potent.  As, in his puppyhood, the looming bulks of the tepees, man-reared, had affected him as manifestations of power, so was he affected now by the houses and the huge fort all of massive logs.  Here was power.  Those white gods were strong.  They possessed greater mastery over matter than the gods he had known, most powerful among which was Grey Beaver.  And yet Grey Beaver was as a child-god among these white-skinned ones.

> A small number of white men lived in Fort Yukon.  These men had been long in the country.  They called themselves Sour-doughs, and took great pride in so classifying themselves.  For other men, new in the land, they felt nothing but disdain.  The men who came ashore from the steamers were newcomers.  They were known as chechaquos, and they always wilted at the application of the name.  They made their bread with baking-powder.  This was the invidious distinction between them and the Sour-doughs, who, forsooth, made their bread from sour-dough because they had no baking-powder.

> Also White Fang had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household.  The latter were afraid of him, while he merely refrained from attacking them.  This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master.  Between White Fang and them existed a neutrality and no more.  They cooked for the master and washed the dishes and did other things just as Matt had done up in the Klondike.  They were, in short, appurtenances of the household.

> Yet again, in this new orientation, it was the thumb of circumstance that pressed and prodded him, softening that which had become hard and remoulding it into fairer form.  Weedon Scott was in truth this thumb.  He had gone to the roots of White Fang’s nature, and with kindness touched to life potencies that had languished and well-nigh perished.  One such potency was love.  It took the place of like, which latter had been the highest feeling that thrilled him in his intercourse with the gods.

.topic[Love]
> As the days went by, the evolution of _like_ into _love_ was accelerated.  White Fang himself began to grow aware of it, though in his consciousness he knew not what love was.  It manifested itself to him as a void in his being—a hungry, aching, yearning void that clamoured to be filled.  It was a pain and an unrest; and it received easement only by the touch of the new god’s presence.  At such times love was joy to him, a wild, keen-thrilling satisfaction.  But when away from his god, the pain and the unrest returned; the void in him sprang up and pressed against him with its emptiness, and the hunger gnawed and gnawed unceasingly.

> But nobody else ever romped with White Fang.  He did not permit it.  He stood on his dignity, and when they attempted it, his warning snarl and bristling mane were anything but playful.  That he allowed the master these liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog, loving here and loving there, everybody’s property for a romp and good time.  He loved with single heart and refused to cheapen himself or his love.

> But with the sheep-dog it was otherwise.  Being a female, she possessed no such instinct.  On the other hand, being a sheep-dog, her instinctive fear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen.  White Fang was to her a wolf, the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers.  And so, as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact, she sprang upon him.  He snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder, but beyond this made no offer to hurt her.  He backed away, stiff-legged with self-consciousness, and tried to go around her.  He dodged this way and that, and curved and turned, but to no purpose.  She remained always between him and the way he wanted to go.

> Weedon Scott had set himself the task of redeeming White Fang—or rather, of redeeming mankind from the wrong it had done White Fang.  It was a matter of principle and conscience.  He felt that the ill done White Fang was a debt incurred by man and that it must be paid.  So he went out of his way to be especially kind to the Fighting Wolf.  Each day he made it a point to caress and pet White Fang, and to do it at length.

> White Fang landed from the steamer in San Francisco.  He was appalled.  Deep in him, below any reasoning process or act of consciousness, he had associated power with godhead.  And never had the white men seemed such marvellous gods as now, when he trod the slimy pavement of San Francisco.  The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings.  The streets were crowded with perils—waggons, carts, automobiles; great, straining horses pulling huge trucks; and monstrous cable and electric cars hooting and clanging through the midst, screeching their insistent menace after the manner of the lynxes he had known in the northern woods.

> All this was the manifestation of power.  Through it all, behind it all, was man, governing and controlling, expressing himself, as of old, by his mastery over matter.  It was colossal, stunning.  White Fang was awed.  Fear sat upon him.

> Life was complex in the Santa Clara Valley after the simplicities of the Northland.  And the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of civilisation was control, restraint—a poise of self that was as delicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as rigid as steel.  Life had a thousand faces, and White Fang found he must meet them all—thus, when he went to town, in to San Jose, running behind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage stopped.  Life flowed past him, deep and wide and varied, continually impinging upon his senses, demanding of him instant and endless adjustments and correspondences, and compelling him, almost always, to suppress his natural impulses.

> It was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring escape of a convict from San Quentin prison.  He was a ferocious man.  He had been ill-made in the making.  He had not been born right, and he had not been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of society.  The hands of society are harsh, and this man was a striking sample of its handiwork.  He was a beast—a human beast, it is true, but nevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterised as carnivorous.
>
> In San Quentin prison he had proved incorrigible.  Punishment failed to break his spirit.  He could die dumb-mad and fighting to the last, but he could not live and be beaten.  The more fiercely he fought, the more harshly society handled him, and the only effect of harshness was to make him fiercer.  Strait-jackets, starvation, and beatings and clubbings were the wrong treatment for Jim Hall; but it was the treatment he received.  It was the treatment he had received from the time he was a little **pulpy** boy in a San Francisco slum—soft clay in the hands of society and ready to be formed into something.
