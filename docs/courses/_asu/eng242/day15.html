    ## Incident
    ### Countee Cullen
    ]
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(For Eric Walrond)_
    
    Once riding in old Baltimore,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,  
    I saw a Baltimorean  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep looking straight at me.
    
    Now I was eight and very small,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was no whit bigger,  
    And so I smiled, but he poked out  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tongue, and called me, “Nigger.”
    
    I saw the whole of Baltimore  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From May until December;  
    Of all the things that happened there  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s all that I remember.

    ## Yet Do I Marvel
    ### Countee Cullen
    ]
    
    I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,  
    And did He stoop to quibble could tell why  
    The little buried mole continues blind,  
    Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,  
    Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus  
    Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare  
    If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus  
    To struggle up a never-ending stair.  
    Inscrutable His ways are, and immune  
    To catechism by a mind too strewn  
    With petty cares to slightly understand  
    What awful brain compels His awful hand.  
    Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:  
    To make a poet black, and bid him sing!

    ## The Negro Speaks of Rivers
    ### Langston Hughes
    ]
    
    I've known rivers:  
    I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow of human blood in human veins.  
    
    My soul has grown deep like the rivers.
    
    I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.  
    I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.  
    I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.  
    I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bosom turn all golden in the sunset.
    
    I've known rivers:  
    Ancient, dusky rivers.  
    
    My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

    ## A Dream Deferred
    ### Langston Hughes
    ]
    
    .center[
    What happens to a dream deferred?
    
    Does it dry up  
    like a raisin in the sun?  
    Or fester like a sore–  
    And then run?  
    Does it stink like rotten meat?  
    Or crust and sugar over–  
    like a syrupy sweet?
    
    Maybe it just sags  
    like a heavy load.
    
    Or does it explode?
