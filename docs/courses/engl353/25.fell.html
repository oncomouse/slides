## Discussion Question (Abi)

> And first, when *God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he them, Male and Female; and God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply: And God said, Behold, I have given you of every Herb*, etc. Genesis 1. Here God joins them together in his own Image, and makes no such distinctions and differences as men do; for though they be weak, he is strong; and as he said to the Apostle, *His Grace is sufficient*, and *his Strength is made manifest in Weakness*, 2 Corinthians 12. 9. And such hath the Lord chosen, *even the weak things of the World, to confound the things which are mighty; and things which are despised, hath God chosen, to bring to nought things that are*, 1 Corinthians 1. And God hath put no such difference between the male and female as men would make.

Throughout the rest of the article, Fell continues to argue in this way (embedding the quotes throughout her own argument).  While the structure of her argument isn't what we are used to seeing, her heavy use of quotes is what really stood out to me.  Do you think that the way she used her quotes to shape her argument affects her ethos as a writer?  For example, do you think that she relies too heavily on quotes or do you think her constant quoting is necessary to get the point across? Moreover, how would the claims in the previous question affect her ethos?  Would you see her as resourceful and clever or unoriginal?

## Discussion Question (Taylor)

> Mark this, you that despise and oppose the Message of the Lord God, that he sends by women; what had become of the Redemption of the whole body of mankind, if they had not believed the message that the Lord Jesus sent by these women, of and concerning his Resurrection? And if these women had not thus, ... how should his Disciples have know, who were not there? (63-64)

Margaret Fell's pamphlet was wildly controversial when published because it argues for women's rights in a time when women were expected to be seen and not heard. She used the words of a patriarchal Christian society against itself to make her message more impactful. This is very relevant to the social justice movement happening right now, over 300 years later. How can this technique be applied to modern times? Are there any examples of this happening in recent decades?

## The Beginning (Reading)
> Whereas it hath been an objection in the minds of many, and several times hath been objected by the clergy, or ministers, and others, against women's speaking in the Church; and so consequently may be taken, that they are condemned for meddling in the things of God, the ground of which objection is taken from the Apostle's words, which he writ in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 14, verses 34-35, and also what he writ to Timothy in the first Epistle, chapter 2, verses 11-12. But how far they wrong the Apostle's intentions in these Scriptures, we shall show clearly when we come to them in their course and order. But first let me lay down how God himself hath manifested his will and mind concerning women, and unto women. (61)

## Verses in Question

**1 Corinthians 14:34-35**: Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

**1 Timothy 2:11-12**: Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.

## Serpent

> It is true, *the Serpent that was more subtle than any other beast of the field* came unto the woman with his temptations and with a lie, his subtlety discerning her to be more inclinable to hearken to him, when he said, *If ye eat, your eyes shall be opened* … Here the woman spoke the truth unto the Lord-see what the Lord saith, verse 15, after he had pronounced sentence on the Serpent: *I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel*, Genesis 3.
>
>Let this Word of the Lord, which was from the beginning, stop the mouths of all that oppose women's speaking in the power of the Lord; for he hath put enmity between the woman and the Serpent; and if the seed of the woman speak not, the seed of the Serpent speaks; for God hath put enmity between the two seeds, and it is manifest that those that speak against the woman and her seed's speaking, speak out of the enmity of the old Serpent's seed. (61)

## Church is a Woman

> Thus much may prove that the Church of Christ is a woman, and those that speak against the woman's speaking speak against the Church of Christ and the seed of the woman, which seed is Christ; that is to say, those that speak against the Power of the Lord and the Spirit of the Lord speaking in a woman, simply by reason of her sex or because she is a woman, not regarding the seed, and Spirit, and Power that speaks in her, such speak against Christ and his Church, and are of the seed of the Serpent, wherein lodgeth the enmity. And as God the Father made no such difference in the first creation, nor ever since between the male and the female, but always out of his mercy and loving-kindness had regard unto the weak, so also, his Son, Christ Jesus, confirms the same thing; when the Pharisees came to him and asked him, if it were lawful for a man to put away his wife, he answered and said unto them, *Have you not read, that he that made them in the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh. Wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder*, Matthew 19. (62)

## Jesus's Example

> Thus we see that Jesus owned the love and grace that appeared in women, and did not despise it, and by what is recorded in the Scriptures, he received as much love, kindness, compassion, and tender dealing towards him from women, as he did from any others, both in his lifetime, and also after they had exercised their cruelty upon him; (63)

## The Whole Body of Mankind

> Mark this, you that despise and oppose the Message of the Lord God, that he sends by women; what had become of the Redemption of the whole body of mankind, if they had not believed the Message that the Lord Jesus sent by these women, of and concerning his Resurrection? And if these women had not thus, out of their tenderness and bowels of love, who had received mercy, and grace, and forgiveness of sins, and virtue, and healing from him, which many men also had received the like, if their hearts had not been so united and knit unto him in love, that they could not depart as the men did, but sat watching, and waiting, and weeping about the sepulchre until the time of his Resurrection, and so were ready to carry his Message, as is manifested; else how should his Disciples have known, who were not there? (63-4)

## Reading Corinthians (Confusion)

> And now to the Apostle's words, which is the ground of the great objection against women's speaking, and first, 1 Corinthians 14. Let the reader seriously read that chapter, and see the end and drift of the Apostle in speaking these words: for the Apostle is there exhorting the Corinthians unto charity, and to desire spiritual gifts, and not to speak in an unknown tongue, and *not to be children in understanding, not to be children in malice, but in understanding to be men; and that the Spirits of the Prophets should be subject to the Prophets, for God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace. And then he says, Let your women keep silence in the church*, etc.
>
> Where it doth plainly appear that the women, as well as others that were among them, were in confusion, for he says, *How is it brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation? Let all things be done to edifying*. Here was no edifying, but all was in confusion, speaking together. Therefore, he saith, *If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at most by three, and that by course, and let one interpret, but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church*. Here the man is commanded to keep silence as well as the woman, when they are in confusion and out of order. (64)

## Reading Corinthians (Law)

> But the Apostle saith further, *They are commanded to be in obedience, as also saith the Law; and if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church*.
>
> Here the Apostle clearly manifests his intent, for he speaks of women that were under the Law, and in that transgression as Eve was, and such as were to learn, and not to speak publicly, but they must first ask their husbands at home, and it was a shame for such to speak in the Church. And it appears clearly, that such women were speaking among the Corinthians, by the Apostle's exhorting them from malice and strife, and confusion, and he preaches the Law unto them, and he saith, *in the Law it is written, with men of other tongues, and other lips, will I speak unto this people*, verse 2. (64)

## Reading Corinthians (Why?)

> And what is all this to women's speaking that have the Everlasting Gospel to preach, and upon whom the Promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and his Spirit poured upon them according to his word, Acts 2:16-18. And if the Apostle would have stopped such as had the Spirit of the Lord poured upon them, why did he say just before, *If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace? And you may all prophesy one by one.* Here he did not say that such women should not prophesy as had the Revelation and Spirit of God poured upon them, but their women that were under the Law, and in the transgression, and were in strife, confusion, and malice in their speaking, for if he had stopped women's praying or prophesying, why doth he say, *Every man praying or prophesying having his head covered, dishonoreth his head; but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head. Judge in your selves, Is it comely that a woman pray or prophesy uncovered? For the woman is not without the man, neither is the man without the woman, in the Lord*, 1 Corinthians 11:3-4, 13. (64)

## Indignity

> And what is all this to such as have the Power and Spirit of the Lord Jesus poured upon them, and have the Message of the Lord Jesus given unto them? Must not they speak the Word of the Lord because of these indecent and unreverent women that the Apostle speaks of, and to, in these two Scriptures? And how are the men of this generation blinded, that bring these Scriptures, and pervert the Apostle's Words, and corrupt his intent in speaking of them? And by these Scriptures, endeavor to stop the Message and Word of the Lord God in women, by condemning and despising of them. If the Apostle would have had women's speaking stopped, and did not allow of them, why did he *entreat his true yokefellow to help those women who labored with him in the gospel* Philippians 4:3. And why did the apostles join together *in prayer and supplication with the women, and Mary the mother of fesus, and with his brethren*, Acts 1:14, if they had not allowed, and had union and fellowship with the Spirit of God, wherever it was revealed in women as well as others? (65)

## Conclusion

> And so let this serve to stop that opposing spirit that would limit the Power and Spirit of the Lord Jesus, whose Spirit is poured upon all flesh, both sons and daughters, now in his Resurrection; and since that the Lord God in the Creation, when he *made man in his own Image, he made them male and female*; and since that Christ Jesus, as the Apostle saith, was made of a woman, and the power of the Highest overshadowed her, and the Holy Ghost came upon her, and the holy thing that was born of her, was called the Son of God; and when he was upon the earth, he manifested his love, and his will, and his mind, both to the woman of Samaria, and Martha, and Mary her sister, and several others, as has been shewed; and after his Resurrection also manifested himself unto them first of all, even before he ascended unto his Father: *Now when jesus was risen, the first day of the week, he appeared first unto Mary Magdalene*, Mark 16:9. And thus the Lord Jesus has manifested himself and his Power, without respect of persons, and solet all mouths be stopped that would limit him, whose Power and Spirit is infinite, that is pouring it upon all flesh.
>
>And thus much in answer to these two Scriptures, which have been such a stumbling block, that the ministers of Darkness have made such a mountain of. But the Lord is removing all this, and taking it out of the way.

## Prolepsis

> A Further Addition in Answer to the Objection concerning Women keeping silent in the Church: *For it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be under obedience: as also saith the Law. If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the Church*: now thus as Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 14:34 is one with that of 1 Timothy 2:11, *Let women learn in silence, with all subjection*.
>
> To which I say, if you tie this to all outward women, then there were many women that were widows which had no husbands to learn of, and many were virgins which had no husbands. (67)
