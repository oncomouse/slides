# Robert of Basevorn <br> *Forms of Preaching* (*Forma Praedicandi*)
---
## Discussion Leader (Elizabeth)

> Thus also many presume to preach on Theology and to call themselves preachers, when they do not even know the form of preaching, which is the system and method of preaching on every subject, as logic is the system of syllogizing in every field of knowledge. (Prologue)

> Preaching is the persuasion of many, within a moderate length of time, to meritorious conduct. (Chapter 1)

> From this authority it is evident that in fruitful preaching there are three things necessarily required: the supreme teacher, God, teaching the intellect, the listener obeying the words of the teacher, and the teaching itself, useful and advantageous. (Chapter 21)

After discussing wisdom and eloquence and which is better at length, do you believe preaching is as important? Is preaching more related to wisdom or to eloquence?

---
## Discussion Leader (Carly)

> It is certain that in the capacity of this word just there is not included the gravity of doctrine, because one can be quite just without teaching anything; and, on the contrary, one can teach right things and yet not be just. (xxiii) 

> The preacher, as far as he can do so according to God, ought to attract the mind of the listeners in such a way as to render them willing to hear and retain. (xxiv) 

How do these two statements relate to Classical ideas of rhetoric? Of sophists? Is the justice-righteousness concept another iteration of wisdom-eloquence, enthymeme-style, *eidos*-*doxa*? Or is Robert of Basevorn bringing up an entirely new debate? 
---
## Discussion Leader (Sarah)

> In the beginning it is also customary to offer a prayer, and that is well, because as Plato says in the *Timaeus*: divine help should be implored in the smallest things. Since even the smallest things cannot occur without its influence, how much more should it be implored in the greatest? Hence Boethius, *De Consolations*: I feel that God must be called upon, without whom no beginning is duly established. (Chapter XXV, first paragraph)

Why does Robert of Basevorn choose to quote Plato? What does this add to his text, if anything?

## Methods of Medieval Preaching

* Outside St. Augustine, early church primarily concerned with *what* to teach
	* Questions of what is Canon
	* Dealing w/ various heresies
	* Compilation of the Vulgate Bible in (382 by St. Jerome)
* Later Middle Ages focused on *how* to preach
	* 1200 and the rise of universities
* Two types:
	* **homilies**—longer text is explained and made adaptable to everyday life
	* **sermons**—based on an explication of a very short text that is divided into fragments

## Method

> In a similar way a stream moves gradually, in an orderly manner, from its source to its mouth. Thus one who deals with the divine word—yes, with any orderly treatise—should make sure that in discussing a subject he has an organized method of procedure. (1)

## The Scholastic Sermon

1. The **thema** is announced. 
1. It is or may be followed by a **protheme** as a kind of prologue, which leads to 
1. A **prayer** for divine assistance.
1. Then the thema is **repeated** or resumed.
1. Some kind of connection to the next part is established, which may be what I will call a bridge passage, or else a longer 
1. **Introduction of the thema**.
1. The **division** follows.
1. The members of the division are **confirmed**. The members are then explained or further developed with various processes including 
1. **Subdivisions** and distinctions as well as 
1. Other **processes of dilatation**.
1. At the end of the development the members may be **tied together**.
1. Finally, the sermon ends with a **closing formula**, essentially a prayer.

## *Thema*

The *thema* must be:

1. Taken from Scripture
1. Short (but not too short)

class: bigger
## *Prothema*

1. Meant to make audience benevolent, docile, and attentive (Cicero)
	* Gain goodwill of audience
	* Show goodwill of speaker
1. Can focus on *ethos* of preacher
	1. Show humility
	1. Desire to lead to salvation
---
class: big
## *Divisio*

1. Breaking a short verse into units of analysis that can be expanded upon
1. Example: "Father, I have sinned against you and against Heaven" (Luke 15:2)
	1. "Father"—Invokes God
	1. "I have sinned"—Exposes his wounds
	1. "Against you"—Exaggerates his sin
	1. "And against Heaven"—Estimates his punishment (*Ars copiosa*)
1. In Cicero, *divisio* refers to the breaking of a case into subpoints
---
class: bigger
## Confirmation

1. Each division *must* be supported with evidence of its worth from Scripture
1. These can be found using a concordance
	1. Medieval Biblical reference
	1. Sorted by topic
1. Additional sources can be brought in through 
	* subdivision (expanding on other distinctions made)
	* dilation (speaking at length on a topic)

## The Scholastic Sermon (w/ Cicero)

1. The **thema** is announced. 
1. It is or may be followed by a **protheme** as a kind of prologue, which leads to 
1. A **prayer** for divine assistance.  (*Exordium*)
1. Then the thema is **repeated** or resumed.
1. Some kind of connection to the next part is established, which may be what I will call a bridge passage, or else a longer 
1. **Introduction of the thema**. (*Narratio*) 
1. The **division** follows. (*Divisio*)
1. The members of the division are **confirmed**. The members are then explained or further developed with various processes including 
1. **Subdivisions** and distinctions as well as 
1. Other **processes of dilatation**. (*Confirmation*)
1. At the end of the development the members may be **tied together**. (*Unitio*)
1. Finally, the sermon ends with a **closing formula**, essentially a prayer.

## Four Causes

> *The Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known* (2 Tim. 4:17)

> The final cause is designated when is said: *The Lord stood by me and strengthened me* ...
>
> Secondly, the efficient cause is designated when is said: *by me* ...
>
> Thirdly, the material cause is designated when is said: *preaching* ...
>
> Fourthly, the formal cause is designated when is said: *may be accomplished* (1)

## Need for Order

> Still, two reasons are assigned for not accepting such themes from an unknown translation: (1) in the first place one who proposes such an unknown theme seems to seek human praise, as if he himself knew unknown things, nor does he preserve the order of learning in which one proceeds from the known to the unknown; (2) if this procedure were allowed liars, heretics, and ignorant men could make themes as they pleased and devise an unknown translation, of which the exemplar could not easily be found, and there would be a great occasion for error (XVI).
