# Madeline de Scudéry, *Of Conversation*
---
## Discussion Leader (Alyssa)

> ...if it is not fitting to be always like Damophilus, talking of Sciences; if it be tedious to discourse of all the little cares of a Family; if it be not convenient to speak often of Cloths; if it is a want of judgement to discourse only of intrigues of Gallantry; if there is but little diversion in speaking of Genalogies if it is too mean to discourse of Lands fold or exchang’d; if it be likewise forbidden to speak too much of our own Affairs; if it too great a gravity id not diverting in Conversation; if there is folly in laughing too often, and in laughing without reason; if the relations of fatal and extraordinary Accidents are not acceptable; if the little Transactions of the Neighborhood are tedious to those who live not thereabouts; if those Conversations of little things that are whispered in the ear, are importunate; if those People are to blame who only discourse of Great Occurrences; if those eternal seekers of Cabinet Counsels are not in the right, what must we then talk of? And of what must the conversation be compos’d to render it both rational and pleasing?

How can we have conversations that are of substance and that are not considered to be a waste of time if every subject is considered to be taboo, inappropriate for the speaker, or inappropriate for the audience?
---
## Conversation

> As Conversation is the bond of all humane Society, the greatest pleasure of well-bred People; and the most ordinary means of introducing into the World, not only Politeness, but also the purest Morals, and the love of Glory and Vertue: Methinks, the Company cannot entertain themselves more profitably, nor more agreeably, said *Cilenia*, then in examining what it is People call Conversation. For when Men only speak strictly according to the exigency of their Affairs, it cannot be so termed. The truth is, said *Amilcar*, a Lawyer pleading a Cause at the Barr; a Merchant negotiating with another; a General of an Army giving Orders; a King speaking of Affairs of State in his Council; all this is not what ought to be stiled Conversation. All those People may discourse well of their Interests, and Affairs: and yet not have that agreeable talent of Conversation, which is the sweetest charm of Life, and perhaps more rare than is believed.

## Purpose of the Work

> You are in the right, said *Cerinta*, for by remarking all that is tiresome, we may better know what is diverting...

---
## We've All Been There

> I gave Yesterday a Family-Visit, which made me do such Pennance, that it almost wearyed me to death. Do but imagine me in the midst of ten or twelve Women, who spoke of nothing else than of all their little Domestic cares, of the faults of their servants, of the good Qualities or Vices of their Children; and there was one Woman amongst the rest who spent above an hour in relating from syllable to syllable the first tatlings of a Son of hers, but of three years old. You may now judge if I did not spend my time after a lamentable manner.
---
## The Sea-Captain

> This is not very agreeable, without doubt, replied Alcaeus, but neither is it so mortifying, as to meet with those People who are engaged in some troublesome business, and can speak of nothing else. And in truth, I found a while ago a Sea-Captain, who pretends *Pittacus* ought to recompense him for a Ship. He held me three hours, not only in relating the reasons he pretended to have for the being re-imbursed; but likewise what might be answered him, and what he could reply. And to make me the better apprehend his losses, he fell to telling me the particulars of what his Ship cost him. For that purpose, he old me the names of those who built it, and specify'd to me all the parts of his Ship, one after the other, without any necessity, for the making me understand it was one of the best and dearest, and he had a great deal of injustice done him.
---
## Headache

> I must allow, said *Amithone*, it is a great persecution to meet with those sort of People, but to tell you the truth, those grave and serious Conversations wherein no mirth is allowed of, have something so pestering and heavy, that I never happen into them without being taken with the Headach; for the discourse is always upon the same note; they never laugh, and all is as precise and formal, as if you were at Church.
---
## Trifling

> I agree with you in what you say, said *Athis*, but I must say, to the shame of our Sex, that the Men have a great advantage over us, as to Conversation; and to prove it, I need only tell the Company, that going to *Lycidices* House, I found here in her Mothers Chamber, where was so great a number of Women, there was hardly room for me, but there was not one Man. I cannot tell you after what manner all those Laides had their Wits turned that day, though some of them were very ingenious. But I am constrained to avow, that the Conversation was not very diverting: for in short, the discourse was only a nauseous trifle; and I may say, that in my life I never heard so many words, so little sense.
---
## Laughter

> Those Conversations are without doubt very vexatious, replied *Amilcar*, but there are of another stamp which do likewise strangely importune me. For I happened to be one day at *Syracuse*, with five or six Women, and two or three Men, who have got a fancy that for the rendering the Conversation agreeable, 'tis requisite to laugh eternally. Insomuch that as long as those persons are together, they do nothing but laugh at all they say to one another, though it be not so over pleasant. And they make so great a noise, that they are no longer able to understand what is spoken in the company: and then they only laugh because the rest laugh, without knowing any other reason. However, they do it as heartily, as if they knew the occasion, and there had been some great jest. But this is strange, their laughing is really sometimes so contagious, one cannot hinder they being taken with their Malady: and happening to be one day with those perpetual laughers, I was so excessively inspired with their laughter, that I laughed almost till I cry'd, without knowing why I did so. But to speak the truth, I was so much ashamed of it within a Quarter of an Hour after, that it turn'd in a moment all my joy into vexation.
---
## Content: Shallow or Deep?

> 'Tis also a great imperfection for one, said *Cerinta*, to affect to show al his Wit, and I know a Man who in the very first visits he makes in places where he would render himself acceptable, passes continually from one subject to another, without examining any to the bottom ... For as Conversation ought to be free and natural, and that all those who compose the Company have equally right to change it as they think fit, it is an importunate thing to meet with those opinionative People, who leave nothing to be said upon a Subject, and who are ever harping upon it, what care soever is taken to interrupt 'em.
---
## How To Speak

> For my part, said *Amithone*, I confess, I could wish there were rules for Conversation, as there are for many other things. The principal rule, replied *Valeria*, is never to say any thing that contradicts the Judgement. But still, added *Nicanor*, I would willingly know more precisely, how you conceive the Conversation ought to be. I conceive, replied she, that to Speak in general, it ought oftner to be common and gallant things, than of great Transactions; but however, I conceive that nothing is forbidden; that it ought to be free and diversified, according to the times, places and persons with whom we are, and the Secret is of Speaking always nobly of mean things, very plainly of high things; and very gallantly of gallant things, without transport and affectation.
---
## Reason and Affectation

> Thus the Conversation ought ever to be equally natural and rational; yet I must say, that on some occasions, the Sciences themselves may be brought in with a good grace, and that agreeable follies may likewise have their place, provided they be ingenious, modest and gallant. Insomuch as to Speak with reason, we may for certain affirm, that there is nothing but may be said in Conversation in case it be manag'd with With and Judgement, and the Party considers well where he is, to whom he Speaks, and who he is himself. Notwithstanding though Judgement be absolutely necessary for the never saying any thing but what is to the purpose; yet, the Conversation must appear so free, as to make it seem we don't reject any of our thoughts, and all is said, that comes into the fancy, without any affected design of speaking rather of one thing or another. For there is no thing more ridiculous than those People, who have Subjects on which they talk Wonders; and in such cases, can say nothing but impertinences. So I would never have it known, what it is we are to say, and yet that we always know well what it is we say. For if this course be taken, Women will not impertinently pretend to be knowing, nor be ignorant to excess, and everyone will say what we ought to say for the rendering the Conversation agreeable.
