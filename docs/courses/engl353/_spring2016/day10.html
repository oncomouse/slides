# Plato, *Gorgias*

## Assignment #1

We have read two Socratic dialogues. In both Socrates debates some question pertinent to the nature of reality with a variety of interlocutors. Given that this form of debate is central to the Western conception of rhetoric, what might Socrates ask after today? Are questions of what is good or true still relevant? Should we still be concerned with writing as a *pharmakon*?

For this assignment, write a 2-3 page paper detailing what you think a Socratic dialog might look like today (in terms of form and content). Then produce a sample of this dialog (written or otherwise) that should run to about 4-5 pages of “text.”

## Dialogue Features

1. Concerned with a central issue (opinion vs. truth; justice vs. rhetoric, etc)
1. Can touch on multiple topics
1. Generally works by assertion and refutation
	1. "Do you think X works like this?"
	1. "No, X works in a different manner: here it is."
	1. "Given that you believe that, do you also believe Y, which follows logically?"
1. Comments on present society as well as Truth
1. Characters are often real (though composites)
1. Usually features Socrates and those that don't have a wise person of some sort

## Discussion Leader (Will)

>  I believe I'm one of a few Athenians-so as not to say I'm the only one, but the only one among our contemporaries- to take up the true political craft and practice the true politics. This is because the speeches I make on each occasion do not aim at gratification but at what's best. (521d-e)

What if, although one practices "good politics", they're unable to convince anyone of "what's best"? Is the benefit Socrates sees of practicing good politics necessarily superior to practicing oratory as Callicles is saying, but with good intent?

## Discussion Leader (Abby)

> But I know this well: that if I do come into court involved in one of those perils which you mention, the man who brings me in will be a wicked man-for no good man could bring in a man who is not a wrongdoer-and it wouldn't be at all strange if I were to be put to death. Would you like me to tell you my reason for expecting this? (521c-d)

Why does Plato have Socrates foreshadow his own death? What is the significance, if any, of this?

## Oratory as a Means of Self Correction

> SOCRATES: so, if oratory is used to defend injustice, Polus, one's own or that of one's relatives, companions, our children, or that of one's country when it acts unjustly, it is of no use to us at all, unless one takes it to be useful for the opposite purpose: that he should accuse himself first and foremost, and then too his family and anyone else dear to him who happens to behave unjustly at any time; and that he should not keep his wrongdoing hidden but bring it out into the open, so that he may pay his due and get well; and compel himself and the others not to play the coward, but to grit his teeth and present himself with grace and courage as to a doctor for cauterization and surgery, pursuing what's good and admirable without taking any account of the pain. And if his unjust behavior merits flogging, he should present himself to be whipped; if it merits imprisonment, to be imprisoned; if a fine, to pay it; if exile, to be exiled; and if execution, to be executed. He should be his own chief accuser, and the accuser of other members of his family, and use his oratory for the purpose of getting rid of the greatest evil, injustice, as the unjust acts are being exposed.  (480c-d)

## Callicles's Rhetoric of Self-Empowerment

> No, no man would put up with suffering what's unjust; only a slave would do so, one who is better dead than alive, who when he's treated unjustly and abused can't protect himself or anyone else he cares about. I believe that the people who institute our laws are the weak and the many. They do this, and they assign praise and blame with themselves and their own advantage in mind. They're afraid of the more powerful among men, the ones who are capable of having a greater share, and so they say that getting more than one's share is "shameful" and "unjust," and that doing what's unjust is trying to get more than one's share. They do this so that those people won't get a greater share than they. I think they like getting an equal share, since they are inferior. (483b-c)

## Ruling Themselves

> SOCRATES: But what of themselves, my friend?
>
> CALLICLES: What of *what*?
>
> SOCRATES: Ruling or being ruled?
>
> CALLICLES: What do you mean?
>
> SOCRATES: I mean each individual ruling himself. Or is there no need at all to rule himself, but only to rule others?
>
> CALLICLES: What do you mean, rule himself?
>
> SOCRATES: Nothing very subtle. Just what the many mean: being self-controlled and master of oneself, ruling the pleasures and the appetites within oneself. (491d-e)

## Knack for Tradition

> SOCRATES: The other, the one concerned with pleasure, to which the whole of its service is entirely devoted, proceeds toward its object quite inexpertly, without having at all considered either the nature of pleasure or its cause. It does so completely irrationally, with virtually no discrimination. Through routine and knack it merely preserves the memory of what customarily happens, and that's how it also supplies its pleasures. (501a-b)

## Justice and the Soul

> SOCRATES: So this is what that skilled and good orator will look to when he applies as all of his actions, and any gift he makes or any confiscation he carries out. He will always give his attention to how justice may come to exist in the souls of his fellow citizens and injustice be gotten rid of, how self-control may come to exist there and lack of discipline be gotten rid of, and how the rest of excellence may come into being there and evil may depart. (505d-e)

## Talking To Himself

> SOCRATES: Listen, then, as I pick up the discussion from the beginning. Is the pleasant the same as the good?—It isn't as Callicles and I have agreed.—Is the pleasant to be done for the sake of the good, or the good for the sake of the pleasant?—The pleasant for the sake of the good.—And *pleasant* is that by which, when it's come to be present in us, we feel pleasure, and good that by which, when it's present in us, we feel pleasure, and good that by which, when some excellence has come to be present in us?—Yes, I do think that's necessarily so, Callicles?... (506c-d)

## Live Beyond Yourself

> SOCRATES: But, my blessed man, please see whether what's noble and what's good isn't something other than preserving and being preserved. Perhaps one who is truly a man should stop thinking about how long he will live. He should not be attached to life but should commit these concerns to the god and believe the women who say that not one single person can escape fate. He should thereupon give consideration to how he might live the part of his life still before him as well as possible. (512d-e)

## The Orator Takes On the Character of the City

> SOCRATES: For each group of people take delight in speeches that are given in its own character, and resents those given in an alien manner. (513b)

> SOCRATES: You sing the praises of those who threw parties for these people, and who feasted them lavishly with what they had an appetite for. And they say that *they* have made the city great! But that the city is swollen and festering, thanks to those early leaders, that they don't notice. For they filled the city with harbors and dockyards, walls, and tribute payments and such trash as that, but did so without justice and self-control. So, when that fit of sickness comes on, they'll blame their advisers of the moment and sing the praises of Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles, if you're not careful, they'll lay their hands on you ... when they lose not only what they gained but what they had original as well (518e-519a)

## The Ending

> SOCRATES: So, listen to me and follow me to where I am, and when you've come here you'll be happy both during life and at its end, as the account indicates. Let someone despise you as a fool and throw dirt on you, if he likes. And, yes, by Zeus, confidently let him deal you that demeaning blow. Nothing terrible will to you if you really are an admirable and good man, one who practices excellence. And then, after we've practiced it then at last, if we think we should, we'll turn to politics, or then we'll deliberate about whatever subject we please, when we're better at deliberating than we are now. For it's a shameful thing for us, being in the condition we appear to be in at present—when we never think the same about the same subjects, the most important ones at that—to sound off as though we're somebodies. That's how far behind in education we've fallen. (527c-e)
