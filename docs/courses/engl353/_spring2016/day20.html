# Anonymous <br> *The Principles of Letter Writing*
---
class: big
## Discussion Leader (Aletsey)

> The Salutation is an expression of greeting conveying a friendly sentiment not inconsistent with the social rank of the persons involved. (V)

The Salutation is explained clearly as the first major part of a letter. Does this look like the way we interact or write now a days? Or did society stop complying to this important part? How do we do or not do this?

## Why Write?

> A written composition is a setting-forth of some matter in writing, proceeding in a suitable order. Or, a written composition is a suitable and fitting treatment of some matter, adapted to the matter itself. Or a written composition is a suitable and fitting written statement about something, either memorized or declared by speech or in writing. (I)
---
## Three Medieval Genres

> Now, some written compositions are metrical, others rhythmic, others prosaic.
> 
> A metrical composition is a written presentation which is properly distinguished by prescribed measures of feet and duration.
> 
> A rhythmic composition is one which is bound together syllabically according to a fixed numerical rule.
> 
> But since it is our intention to treat only prose composition, let us describe more carefully what it is and how it should be written.
> 
> A prose composition is a written presentation ignoring the measures of meter, and proceeding in a continuous and suitable order. Now, here let us describe the proper meaning of this first term, for, in Greek, *proson* is said to be "continuous." Then, we say that a written statement is "suitable" in which we treat the subject under discussion in words ordered according to the grammatical rules for prose or poetry. (I)
---
## What is a letter?

### III. The Definition of a Letter

> An epistle or letter, then, is a suitable arrangement of words set forth to express the intended meaning of its sender. Or in other words, a letter is a discourse composed of coherent yet distinct parts signifying fully the sentiments of its sender.

### IV. The Parts of a Letter

> There are, in fact, five parts of a letter: the Salutation, the Securing of Good-will, the Narration, the Petition, and the Conclusion.
---
## Classification

> It is said to be "prescribed" if the name of the recipient is written first, followed by those things which are joined with that person's name, in this manner: "To G—, the most intimate of friends and the most eminent in the glory of all worthiness, F—, the student of letters who is ever so slow yet is also persistent, expresses greetings and the feeling of warm affection."
> 
> Next, a salutation is called "subscribed" if the name of the recipient is placed at the end, with those things which are joined with it coming before in such a way that the name is as clearly revealed in the preceding salutation as it would be if the whole were written in the opposite order.
> 
> A salutation is said to be "circumscribed" if the name of the recipient is written in several places in this way: "To Innocentius, revered in Christ our Lord, by the grace of God the highest Pontiff and universal Pope of all the holy church, R—, the bishop of Verona conveys due reverence in Christ." (V)
---
## Rhetorical Salutation

> Now, if we want to add something to the names of the senders, let it at least be made suitable, since it should be chosen to indicate humility and certainly not pride. It is therefore necessary for us to be guided by the ranks of the persons involved in such a way that, as often as names of ecclesiastical ranks or professional status are joined with the names of the senders, they will be qualified by added phrases so that through them no pride whatsoever is displayed; for example, if it is a clerk or someone of ecclesiastical status, he should always be titled thus: "Johannes, clerk" or "deacon" or "bishop" or "abbot," ... "although unworthy" or "undeserving" or "sinful." In secular positions or offices, of course, it is not necessary for it to be done in this way, if we say for instance: "N—, friend of the Tuscans," or "N—, Duke of Venice," or "Marshall of Tusca" and the like.
> 
> Next, it should be noted in regard to salutations that the names of the recipients should always be placed before the names of the senders, whether with all their adjectives in the dative case or, likewise with all their adjectives in the accusative, unless–and only when–a more important man is writing to a less important man. For then the name of the sender should be placed first, so that his distinction is demonstrated by the very position of the names. (V)
---
## Invention

> Therefore, when a letter-writer (*dictator*) undertakes to write, and the difference between the ranks of the persons involved is known, he must take into consideration from the first whether the purpose is for one man to write to one other man, or for one to write to several, or several to one, or several to several; and whether equal is writing to equal, inferior to superior, or superior to inferior.
> 
> Next, the kind of subject must be considered, so that the writer may fashion the salutation with words suitable and prescribed according to it.
> 
> Next, the writer should know what is fitting to be attached to the names of the persons involved, as for instance the proper ending of any salutation. (V)
---
## Language of Salutations

>  And it should also be noted that the same prelates of churches, even if they are writing to subordinates who are under their own authority, do not send "blessings" to them unless they are priests; "greetings with a feeling of friendship" or whatever is appropriate are sent between friends. If, on the other hand, they are not priests, they should be sent "greetings with a feeling of esteem."
> 
> In a letter of suspension, excommunication, or harsh reproof, they should write simply as follows: "N—, by the grace of God bishop of Faventia, to N—, an elder"–and nothing else, as "writes this letter" will be understood. If, however, it is necessary to convey a warning, the salutation should say "greetings according to merit," or "favor where it is considered deserved," or "friendship which is deserved by worthiness," or "greetings as they can be deservedly bestowed." (V)
---
## Name and Goodwill

> Furthermore it is a custom to take the material of the salutation from the name of the recipient in such a way that we urge him to greater good-will. In this way, for example, if he is called Benedictus or Gratianus or Johannes (which means "grace of God"), or Benignus or Amatus or some similar names, we can begin in someone's salutation as follows:
> 
> To Benedictus by name: "To the man of all wisdom by divine grace, Benedictus by grace, Benedictus by name, Benedictus even by deed, N— offers loyal service and wishes the protection of divine blessings."
> 
> To Gratianus by name: "Gratianus, resplendent by divine grace both in deeds and in honors, N— wishes to be uplifted always by divine grace and not ever to be disturbed by any evil."
> 
> To any whatsoever: "Maximus" or "Honorius" or "Odorius, blessed with invigorating spirits," or "Desiderius, desirable according to the meaning of his name itself, N— wishes to flourish in prosperous successes and to shine forth in the fame of all honor." (V)
---
## Goodwill

>  Besides, very often the largest part of the securing of goodwill is in the course of the salutation itself. For that reason we should devise our letters in such a way that whenever the humility of the sender or the merits of the recipient are advanced at large in the salutation, we should either begin the rest of the letter immediately with the narration or with the petition, or we should point out our own goodwill rather briefly and modestly.
> 
> Also, in the remaining parts of the letter a not inconsiderable goodwill is expressed again and again–such as in certain names indicating the honor or glory of the recipient's office or rank. The recipient himself would be called many times "father" or "lord" or "eminent pontiff" or "noble duke" or "closest of comrades" according to the principles of variation noted earlier. (VI)

## "Present Themselves"

> The Narration is the orderly account of the matter under discussion, or, even better, a presentation in such a way that the materials seem to present themselves. We should by all means run through such a Narration quickly and clearly for the advantage of the sender's cause. (VII)

---
## Petition

> A petition is supplicatory when we entreat by prayers that something be done or not done. Minors often use this form.
> 
> A Petition is didactic when we seek, through precepts, that something be done or not done. It is menacing, when we do it with threats; after all, someone's official office is in a sense a threat, as for instance when a bishop sends a message to admonish one of his subordinates under the force of his office, or when some lord addresses a slave under threat of cutting out his eyes or head or his right hand, and the like.
> 
> A Petition is exhortative when we seek through urging that something be done or not done; admonitory, through admonishing; advisory, through advising, reproving, through chiding.
> 
> On the other hand, it is said to be direct when we ask that something be done or not done in none of these ways, but only by indicating or writing it directly. (VIII)
---
## Variation

> However, if the Narration is not used, the letter will not be whole with only the remaining two parts. Thus the beginning of a properly shortened letter will be at the Narration, in this way: "It has been indicated," or "It is revealed to us," or "We have learned through the reliable account of many men...."
> 
> Again, though, if the Salutation is removed from the beginning, the letter will remain complete with only the remaining four parts. Indeed this is sometimes done, so that when someone wishes to declare the scorn or anger or passion of an indignant mind, he would present no Salutation but would merely use the regular place of the Salutation to list the names involved--for example, "Petrus to Johannes"; or he may wish to indicate something signifying greater disdain of spirit, as follows: "Petrus to Johannes, worthless and deservedly forsaken servant," and the like. On the other hand, the Salutation is sometimes left unsaid out of fear, as in Sallust: "Who I am you will learn from what is being sent to you." (VIII)

class: bigger
## Resembles Nothing

> Again it should be noted that the Salutation with the Narration alone, or the Petition alone, constitutes a complete letter; but with a Securing of Goodwill alone, or with a Conclusion alone, it does not resemble anything. (VIII)
---
## Authorship

> It is especially necessary for this adaptation to circumstances to be made smooth and harmonious and resplendent in the judicious use of words. Since that capacity is acquired by the judgment of the ears and experience in writing--rather than by any very fixed precepts--we are contenting ourselves in this book with providing some basic skills for the untrained.
> 
> Now let us postpone no longer the discussion of the syntax of a letter.
> 
> [At this point the author adds a brief discussion of the eight parts of speech, the six case endings of words, and other matter concerning the "construction" or grammatical form of a written composition. The discussion of syntax is largely taken from the Roman grammarian Priscian (fl. 550 A.D.), whose *Ars grammatica* concludes with two chapters which circulated separately in the middle ages under the title On Constructions (*De constructionibus*).] (XIII)
