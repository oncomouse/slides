## What's the Deal with the Spelling?

> Every question, or demaunde in thynges, is of two sortes. Either it is an infinite question, and without ende, or els it is definite, and comprehended within some ende.

## Rhetoric and the Dawn of Time

> And therefore, whereas men liued brutishly in open feeldes, hauing neither house to shroude them in, nor attire to clothe their backes, nor yet any regard to seeke their best auaile: these appointed of GOD called them together by vtteraunce of speech, and perswaded with them what was good, what was bad, & what was gainful for mankind. And although at first the rude could hardly learne, and either for the straungenesse of the thing, would not gladly receiue the offer, or els for lack of knowledge, could not perceiue the goodnesse: yet being somewhat drawne, and delited with the pleasantnesse of reason, and the sweetnesse of vtteraunce: after a certaine space they became through Nurture and good aduisement, of wilde, sober: of cruell, gentle: of fooles, wise: and of beastes, men: such force hath the tongue, and such is the power of Eloquence and reason, that most men are forced euen to yeeld in that which most standeth against their will ...

> Neither can I see that men could haue beene brought by any other meanes, to liue together in fellowship of life, to maintaine Cities, to deale truely, and willingly obeye one an other, if men at the first had not by art and eloquence, perswaded that which they full oft found out by reason.

## Eloquence vs. Rhetorique

> And the reason is, that eloquence it selfe, came not vp first by the art, but the arte rather was gathered vpon eloquence. For wisemen seeing by much obseruation and diligent practise, the compasse of diuers causes, compiled thereupon precepts and lessons, worthy to be knowne and learned of all men. Therefore before arte was inuented, eloquence was vsed, and through practise made perfect, the which in all things is a soueraigne meane, most highly to excell ...

> Againe, the arte helpeth well to dispose and order matters of our owne inuention, the which wee may followe as well in speaking as in writing, for though many by nature without art, haue proued worthy men, yet is arte a surer guide then nature, considering we see as liuely by arte what we do, as though we read a thing in writing, where as Natures doings are not so open to all men. Againe, those that haue good wittes by Nature, shall better encrease them by arte, and the blunt also shall bee whetted through arte, that want Nature to helpe them forward. (Book I)

## Away w/ Latin

*A Philosophers wittie saying to a yong man that sought to speake dark language.*

Sirha (quoth he) when our olde great auncesters and Graundsires were aliue, they spake plainly in their mothers tongue, and vsed olde language, such as was spoken then at the building of Roome. But you talke me such a Latine, as though you spake with them euen now, that were two or three thousand yeres agoe, and onely because you would haue no man to vnderstand what you say. Now, were it not better for thee a thousande fold, (thou foolish fellowe) in seeking to haue thy desire, to holde thy peace, and speake nothing at all? For then by that meanes, fewe should knowe what were thy meaning. But thou saiest, the olde antiquitie doth like thee best, because it is good, sober, and modest. Ah, liue man, as they did before thee, and speake thy mind now as men doe at this day. And remember that which CÃ¦sar saieth, beware as long as thou liuest of straunge wordes, as thou wouldest take heede and eschue great Rockes in the Sea. (Book I)

## Tell Their Mynde in English

> Many are wise, but fewe haue the gift to set forth their wisedome. Many can tel their mind in English, but fewe can vse meete termes and apt order: such as all men should haue, and wisemen will vse: such as needes must bee had when matters should be vtterd. Now then what is he at whom al men wonder, and stand in a mase at the vewe of his wit: whose doings are best esteemed? (Book III)
---
## Ynkehorne Termes

> Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to speake as is commonly receiued: neither seeking to be ouer fine, nor yet liuing ouer-carelesse vsing our speeche as most men doe, and ordering our wittes as the fewest haue done. Some seeke so far for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers language. And I dare sweare this, if some of their mothers were aliue, thei were not able to tell what they say: and yet these fine English clerkes will say, they speake in their mother tongue, if a man should charge them for counterfeiting the Kings English. Some farre iourneyed gentlem[e]n at their returne home, like as they loue to goe in forraine apparell, so thei wil pouder their talke with ouersea language. He that commeth lately out of Fraunce, will talke French English and neuer blush at the matter. An other chops in with English Italienated, and applieth the Italian phrase to our English speaking, the which is, as if an Oratour that professeth to vtter his mind in plaine Latine, would needes speake Poetrie, and farre fetched colours of straunge antiquitie. (Book III)

## Darke Woordes

> The vnlearned or foolish phantasticall, that smelles but of learning (such fellowes as haue seen learned men in their daies) wil so Latin their tongues, that the simple can not but wonder at their talke, and thinke surely they speake by some reuelation. I know them that thinke Rhetorique to stande wholie vpon darke wordes, and hee that can catche an ynke horne terme by the taile, him they coumpt to be a fine Englisheman, and a good Rhetorician.
---
## Greeke and Latine

> Now whereas wordes be receiued, aswell Greeke as Latine, to set forth our meaning in the English tongue, either for lacke of store, or els because we would enrich the language: it is well doen to vse them, and no man therein can be charged for any affectation, when all other are agreed to followe the same waie. There is no man agreeued when he heareth (Letters Patents) and yet Patentes is Latine, and signifieth open to all men. The Communion is a fellowship, or a comming together, rather Latin then English: the kings prerogatiue declareth his power roiall aboue al other, and yet I know no man greeued for these termes, being vsed in their place, nor yet any one suspected for affectation, when such generall wordes are spoken. The folie is espied, when either we will vse such wordes as fewe men doe vse, or vse them out of place, when an other might serue much better. Therefore to auoide such folly, we may learne of that most excellent Oratour Tullie, who in his third booke, where he speaketh of a perfect Oratour, declareth vnder the name of Crassus, that for the choise of words fower things should chefly be obserued. First that such words as we vse, should be proper vnto the tongue wherein wee speake, againe, that they bee plaine for all men to perceiue ... (Book III)

## Great Chain of Being

> And what though it often so happeneth (God wot the more pitty) yet in speaking at the least, let vs keepe a naturall order, and set the man before the woman for maners sake.
> 
> An other comming home in haste, after a long iourney, saieth to his man: Come hether sir knaue, helpe me of with my bootes and my spurres. I praie you sir, giue him leaue first to plucke of your spurres, ere he meddle with your bootes, or els your man is like to haue a madde plucking. Who is so foolish as to say, the Counsaile and the King, but rather the King and his Counsaile, the Father and the Sonne, and not contrary. And so likewise in all other, as they are in degree first euermore to set them formost.
> 
> The wise therefore talking of diuers worthie men together, will first name the worthiest, and keepe a decent order in reporting of their tale. (Book III)
