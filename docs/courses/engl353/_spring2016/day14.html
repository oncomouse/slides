## Discussion Leader (Serita)

> This art, if indeed it be an art, contains no directions for discovering truth, but only for testing it. For as to every proposition that we enunciate with an affirmation of its truth or falsity, if it be affirmed without qualification, the dialecticians undertake to decide whether it be true or false…In this connexion then that eminent Stoic is of no help to us, since he does not teach me how to discover what to say; and he actually hinders me, by finding many difficulties which he pronounces quite insoluble, and by introducing a kind of diction that is not lucid, copious and flowing, but meagre, spiritless, cramped and paltry… Let us therefore renounce entirely that art which insight of has too little to say when proofs are being thought out, and too much when they are being assessed. (II.xxxviii)

What is the difference between “discovering” truth and “testing” it and in what ways does the practice of discerning right and wrong hinder a rhetorician?

## Discussion Leader (Caitlin)

> It would be a long story for me to unfold just now the right way to corroborate or weaken witnesses, documents or examinations. All this demands no great talent but vast practice, and Art and her maxims only to this extent—that it be illuminated by good and effective diction. So too those subjects of the other class, produced entirely by the orator, are easy enough to think out, but call for clearer and highly finished exposition. Thus, while in our cases we have these two objectives, first what to say, and secondly how to say it, the former, which seems to be art pure and simple, cannot indeed dispense with art, though it needs but ordinary skill to discover what ought to be said; but it is in the latter that the orator's godlike power and excellence are discerned, that is, his delivery of what he has to say in a style elegant, copious and diversified.

Why would he consider the "what" of the orator's argument the obvious "art" of the two, as opposed to the "how"?

## *Imitatio* (Antonius)

> Let this then be my first counsel, that we show the student whom to copy, and to copy in such a way as to strive with all possible care to attain the most excellent qualities of hismodel. Next let practice be added, whereby in copying he may reproduce the pattern of his choice and not portray him as time and again I have known many copyists do, who in copying hunt after such characteristics as are easily copied or even abnormal and possibly faulty. For nothing is easier than to imitate a man's style of dress, pose or gait. Moreover, if there is a fault, it is not much trouble to appropriate that and to copy it ostentatiously, just as that Fufius, who even now is raving in the political world, though his voice has gone, fails to attain the energy in speaking which Gaius Fimbria certainly possessed, though hitting off his uncouth mouthings and broad pronunciation, For all that, however, he did not know how to choose the model whom he would most willingly resemble, and it was positively the faults in his chosen pattern that he elected to copy. (II.xxii)

## Gifted Individuals (Antonius)

> But what little I can do in this direction can be judged from my financial situation, and in the other from what I say. And indeed we see that there are many who copy no man, but gain their objects by natural aptitude, without resembling any model. And the truth of this may be observed in you two, Caesar and Cotta, for one of you has acquired a degree of humor and with unusual in orators, at any rate in our own, and the other a thoroughly keen and subtle type of oratory. (II.xxii)

## Novelty is Gone?

> It is related that Gorgias of Leontini was the author of this practice, who was thought to be undertaking and professing something very magnificent when he advertised himself as ready for any topic whatever on which anyone might have a fancy to hear him. Later, however, they began to do this everywhere, and are doing it to this day, with the result of there being no theme so vast, so unforeseen, or so novel, that they do not claim to be prepared to say about it all that there is to be said. (I.xxii)

## Precedent as Rhetoric (Antonius)

> However, to introduce at last this man we are portraying to the business of trials and lawsuits, especially such cases as involve rather more trouble,—someone will perhaps laugh at this axiom, for it is not so much shrewd as necessary, and comes from an adviser who is no fool, rather than from a learned Master—we shall first instruct him to get up carefully and thoroughly whatever cases he proposes to conduct. This is no canon of the schools, for the cases set to the boys are simple. ' Statute forbids a foreigner to mount the wall ; a foreigner mounts ; he has driven ofF the enemy ; he is prosecuted.' It is no trouble to get up a case like that, and so they are right in giving no directions for mastering the case, for this is just about the type of wording in cases set in the schools. But in the law-courts documents, evidence, informal agreements, formal contracts, relationship by blood or marriage, magisterial orders, opinions of counsel, and finally the life-history of the parties to the proceedings, must all be examined; and we see that it is generally through neglect of these matters that cases are lost, particularly such as concern private rights, for these are often of peculiar difficulty. (II.xxiv)

## Three Heads 1 & 2  (Antonius)

> Thus in Court the first class of cases is that of disputed facts; debate generally proceeds from something still to come, seldom from anything present or past.
>
> Often too the question is not whether something be the fact or not, but what is its nature ; as, when I heard Gaius Carbo, in his consulship, defending Lucius Opimius before the people, he denied no detail of the killing of Gaius Gracchus, but urged that it was justifiable and for the public safety ... (II.xxv)

## Three Heads 3 (Antonius)

Again the question is one of definition, when the terms in which an act should be described are in dispute, as in the main contention between myself and our friend Sulpicius at the trial of Norbanus. For, while admitting most of our friend's indictment, I still maintained that the defendant was not guilty of 'treason,' since the whole case depended on the construction of this word, by virtue of the Statute of Appuleius. And in such proceedings some lay down a rule that each side shall concisely define the debatable term, a proposition which I myself always think thoroughly childish. For definition of terms is another thing when controversy arises among specialists touching the intimate concerns of the arts, for instance when inquiry is made as to the essential nature of an art, a statute or a community, in which circumstances scientific method ordains that the significance of whatever you are defining shall be made plain, with no omission or redundance. But in that case of ours Sulpicius did no such thing nor did I attempt it, since we both, to the utmost of our power, enlarged with all our fluency upon the meaning of 'act of treason.' For, in the first place, if the addition or substraction of a word be seized on, a definition is often wrung from our grasp, and then too the very suggestion savours of the schools and a training little better than elementary, and lastly the definition cannot reach the understanding and reason of the arbitrator, as It slips by him before he has taken it in. (II.xxv)

## Three Objects (Antonius)

> But to return at length to my own plan. Three As soon then as I have received my instructions and the case and taken the matter in hand, the very first thing I determine is that point to which I must devote all such part of my speech as belongs peculiarly to the issue and the verdict. Next I con- template with the utmost care those other two essentials, the one involving the recommendation of myself or my clients, the other designed to sway the feelings of the tribunal in the desired direction. Thus for purposes of persuasion the art of speaking relies wholly upon three things: the proof of our allegations, the winning of our hearers' favour, and the rousing of their feelings to whatever impulse our case may require. (II.xxvii)

## Dialectic?

> do you observe that..., it was Diogenes who claimed to be teaching an art of speaking well, and of distinguishing truth from error, which art he called by the Greek name of dialectic? This art, if indeed it be an art, contains no directions for discovering truth, but only for testing it. For as to every proposition that we enunciate with an affirmation of its truth or falsity, if it be affirmed without qualification, the dialecticians undertake to decide whether it be true or false; and, if again it be stated hypothetically, with collateral propositions annexed, then they decide whether these others are properly annexed, and whether the conclusion drawn from each and every reasoning is correct: and in the end they prick themselves with their own barbs, and by wide investigation discover not only difficulties such as they themselves can no longer solve, but also others by which webs already attacked, or rather well-nigh unwound, are tangled up again. In this connexion then that eminent Stoic is of no help to us, since he does not teach me how to discover what to say; and he actually hinders me, by finding many difficulties which he pronounces quite insoluble, and by introducing a kind of diction that is not lucid, copious and flowing, but meagre, spiritless, cramped and paltry; and, if any man commends this style, it will only be with the qualification that it is unsuitable to an orator. (II.xxxviii)
---
## Aristotle

> And between this Aristotle ... and these true professors of this art, there seemed to me to be this difference,—that he surveyed these concerns of the art of rhetoric, which he disdained, with that same keen insight, by which he had dis- cerned the essential nature of all things ; whereas those others, considering this the only thing worth cultivating, have dwelt upon the treatment of this single subject, without his sagacity, but, in this one instance, with larger practice and closer application. As for Carneades, however, the extraordinary power and diversity of his oratory would be extremely to our liking; since, in those debates of his he supported no contention without proving it, and attacked none which he did not overthrow. (II.xxxviii)
