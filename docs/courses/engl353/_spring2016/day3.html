## Discussion Leader (Matt)

> For just as different drugs dispel different secretions from the body, and some bring an end to others delight, some cause fear, others make the hearers bold, and some drug and bewitch the soul with a kind of evil persuasion. (Section 14, 53)

## Encomium

> Praise is the expression in words of the eminence of a man's good qualities, and therefore we must display his actions as the product of such qualities. Encomium refers to what he has actually done; the mention of accessories, such as good birth and education, merely helps to make our story credible -- good fathers are likely to have good sons, and good training is likely to produce good character. Hence it is only when a man has already done something that we bestow encomiums upon him. Yet the actual deeds are evidence of the doer's character: even if a man has not actually done a given good thing, we shall bestow praise on him, if we are sure that he is the sort of man who would do it. To call any one blest is, it may be added, the same thing as to call him happy; but these are not the same thing as to bestow praise and encomium upon him; the two latter are a part of "calling happy," just as goodness is a part of happiness. (Aristotle, Rhetoric, Book I, Chapter 9)

## Style

**1.** What is becoming to a city is manpower, to a body beauty, to a soul wisdom, to an action virtue, to a speech truth, and the opposite of these are unbecoming. Man and woman in speech and deed and city and object should be honored with praise if praiseworthy and incur blame it on worthy, for it is unequal error and mistake to blame the praiseable and praise the blamable. (George A Kennedy, 1972)

**1.** Embellishment to a city is the valor of its citizens; to a person, comeliness; to a soul, wisdom; to a deed, virtue; to discourse, truth. But the opposite to these is lack of embellishment. Now a man, woman, discourse, work, city, deed, if deserving of praise must be honored with praise, but if undeserving must be censured. For it is alike aberration and stultification to censure the commendable and commend the censurable. ([LaRue Van Hook, 1919](https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4386697/4386697_djvu.txt))

**1.** Fairest ornament to a city is a goodly army and to a body beauty and to a soul wisdom and to an action virtue and to a speech truth, but there opposites are unbefitting. Man and woman and speech and deed and city and object should be honored with praise if praiseworthy, but on the unworthy blame should be laid; for it is equal error and ignorance to blame the praiseworthy and to praise the blameworthy. (George A Kennedy, 1990)

## Style (Novelty)

They are antithesis, paronomasia, alliteration, repetition of words, likeness of sound in final syllables of successive words and clauses, and arrangement of words in nearly equal periods. Add to these, alternating amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets. (Van Hook)

1. Likeness of sound in final syllabes (examples)
	* [in 2] "But I desire by rational calculation to free the lady's reputation"
	* [in 4] "all came because of amorous contention and ambitious pretention"
	* [in 7] "meet with verbal accusation, legal reprobation and actual condemnation"

## Style (Magic)

> I both deem and define all poetry as speech with meter. Fearful shuddering and tearful pity and grievous longing come upon its hearers, and at the actions and physical sufferings of others in good fortunes and in evil fortunes, through the agency of words, the soul is wont to experience a suffering of its own. (52)

## Novelty & Reason

> For my part, by introducing some reasoning in to my speech, I wish to free the accuse of blame and, having reproved her detractors as prevaricators and proved the truth, to free her from ignorance. (50)

Using reason to confront myth/opinion (*doxa*)

## Reason (Structure of Argument)

Four Reasons for Helen's Ignominy:

1. Love
1. Violence
1. Persuasion
1. Divine Intervention

## Persuasion (Magic)

> Sacred incantations sung with words are bearers of pleasure and banishers of pain, for, merging with opinion in the soul, the power of the incantation is wont to beguile it and persuade it and alter it by witchcraft. There have been discovered two arts of witchcraft and magic: one consists of errors of soul and the other of deceptions of opinion. (52)

class: big
## Persuasion (Opinion)

> All who have and to persuade people of things to do so by molding or false argument. For if all men on all subjects had both memory of things past and awareness of things present and for knowledge of the future, speech would not be similarly similar, since as things are now it is not easy for them to recall the past nor to consider the present nor to predict the future. So that on most subjects most men take opinion as counselor to their soul, but since opinion is slippery and insecure it cast those implying it into slippery and insecure successes. (52)

class: big

## Persuasion

> To understand that persuasion, when added to speech, is wont also to impress the soul as it wishes, one must study: first, the words of astronomers who, substituting opinion for opinion, taking away one but creating another, make what is incredible and unclear seem true to the eyes of opinion; then, second, logically necessary debates in which a single speech, written with art but not spoken with truth, bends a great crowd and persuades; and third, the verbal dispute of philosophers in which of the swiftness of thought is also shown making the belief in an opinion subject to easy change.

class: big

## The Conclusion?

> I have by means of speech removed disgrace from a woman; I have observed the procedure which I set up at the beginning of the speech; I have tried to end the injustice of blame and ignorance of opinion; I wished to write a speech which would be a praise of Helen and a diversion to myself. (54)

1. Is this a speech praising Helen?
1. What does Gorgias mean by "diversion"?
