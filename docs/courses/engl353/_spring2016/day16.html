# Quintilian <br> *Institutes of Oratory* <br> Book X & XII
---
## Discussion Leader (Serita)

> Let us grant, however, what nature herself by no means brings to pass—that a bad man has been found endowed with consummate eloquence. I should nevertheless refuse to concede to him the name of orator, as I should not allow the merit of fortitude to all who have been active in the field, because fortitude cannot be conceived as unaccompanied with virtue. Does he who is employed to defend causes not need integrity which covetousness cannot pervert, or partiality corrupt, or terror abash? Shall we honor the traitor, the renegade, and the prevaricator with the sacred name of orator. (XII.i.23-24)

Do you agree that one cannot be a true orator without being a noble and good person? What is Quintilian’s definition of “consummate eloquence” and is he right to assume that a bad man could never be endowed with this?

---
## Discussion Leader (Ana)

> It is necessary, too, for the master to teach and for the pupil to learn how difficult cases are to be treated in attempting to establish them, for very often even the best causes resemble bad ones. An innocent person under accusation may be urged by many probabilities against him, and he must then be defended by the same process of pleading as if he were guilty. There are also innumerable particulars common alike to good and bad causes, such as oral and written evidence, and suspicions and prejudices to be overcome. But what is probable is established or refuted by the same methods as what is true. The speech of the orator, therefore, will be modeled as circumstances shall require, with uprightness of intention being always maintained. (XII.I.45) 

Many well-intentioned causes in the United States have historically come under public scrutiny, typically because of the same personal suspicions and prejudices addressed in the passage. This can still be seen today with movements such as the fight for gender equality or Black Lives Matter. How would an orator today discern a good cause from a bad cause? If an orator must be a good person who thoroughly studies morality, then how is this further complicated by the presence of technology? 

---
## Limits of a Copy (Simulacrum)

> Moreover, everything that resembles something else must necessarily be inferior to that of which it is a copy, as the shadow to the substance, the portrait to the natural face, and the player's acting to the real feeling. The same is the case with regard to oratorical composition, for in the originals we take for our models there is nature and real power, while every imitation, on the contrary, is something counterfeit and seems adapted to an object not its own. (X.ii.11)

> Nor let those who have sufficient judgment for avoiding faults, be satisfied with forming a semblance, a mere cuticle of excellence, if I may so express myself, or rather one of those images of Epicurus, which he says are perpetually flying off from the surfaces of bodies. (X.ii.15)
---
## Store of Examples (Jump Ahead)

> Above all things, an orator should be furnished with an ample store of examples, both ancient as well as modern, since he should not only be acquainted with matters which are recorded in history, or transmitted from hand to hand, as it were, by tradition or are of daily occurrence, but should not even be neglectful of the fictions of the more eminent poets. For those of the former kind have the authority of testimonies or even of precedents, and the latter sort are either supported by the sanction of antiquity or are supposed to have been invented by great men to serve as precepts. 2. Let the orator, therefore, know as many as possible of every kind, for hence it is that greater authority is attributed to old men, as they are thought to have known and seen more than others, a fact to which Homer frequently attests. But we must not wait till the last stage of life to acquire authority, for study affords us such advantage that, as far as knowledge of events is concerned, we seem even to have lived in past ages. (XII.iv.1-2)

---
## Slowness and Writing

> From my disapprobation of carelessness in writing, it is clearly enough seen what I think of the fine fancy of dictation, for in the use of the pen, the hand of the writer, however rapid, as it cannot keep pace with the celerity of his thoughts, allows them some respite. But he to whom we dictate urges us on, and we feel ashamed at times to hesitate, or stop, or alter, as if we were afraid to have a witness of our weakness. Hence it happens that not only inelegant and casual expressions, but sometimes unsuitable ones, escape us, because our sole anxiety is to make our discourse connected. (X.iii.9-10)

> Some lesser matters also (though nothing is little that relates to study) must not be left unnoticed, one of which is that we can write best on waxen tablets from which there is the greatest facility for erasing, unless, perchance, weakness of sight requires the use of parchment. Though it assists the sight, parchment causes delay and interrupts the current of thought from the frequent movement of the hand, backwards and forwards, while dipping the pen in the ink. (X.iii.31)
---
## Meditation & Writing

> NEXT to writing is *meditation*, which indeed derives strength from it and is something between the labor of writing and the trial of our fortune in extemporary speaking. I do not know whether it is more frequently used than either, for we cannot write everywhere and at all times, but there is abundance of time and room for thought. Meditation may in a very few hours embrace all points of the most important causes. When our sleep is broken at night, meditation is aided by the very darkness. Between the different stages in the pleading of a cause, it finds some room to exercise itself and never allows itself to be idle. Nor does it only arrange within its circle the order of things (which would itself be a great assistance to us), but forms an array of words and connects together the whole texture of speech, with such effect that nothing is wanting but to write it down. Indeed, in general, ideas are more firmly fixed in the memory if our attention does not relax its hold on them by trusting too securely to writing.
>
> But we cannot arrive at such power of thought suddenly or even soon. (X.vi.1-2)

## Famous Definition

> LET the orator whom I propose to form, then, be such a one as is characterized by the definition of Marcus Cato, **a good man skilled in speaking**. (XII.i.1)

Often rendered: "a good man speaking well"

## Famous Statements About Rhetoric (so far)

1. Rhetoric is "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion" (Aristotle)
1. The Orator is "a good man speaking well" (Quintilian)

---
## Explanation

> But the requisite which Cato has placed first in this definition—that an orator should be a good man—is naturally of more estimation and importance than the other. It is important that an orator should be good because, should the power of speaking be a support to evil, nothing would be more pernicious than eloquence alike to public concerns and private. I myself, who, as far as is in my power, strive to contribute something to the faculty of the orator, should deserve very ill of the world, since I should furnish arms, not for soldiers, but for robbers. (XII.i.1)
---
## Why So Much Eloquence?

> But I fancy that I hear some (for there will never be wanting men who would rather be eloquent than good) saying "Why then is there so much art devoted to eloquence? Why have you given precepts on rhetorical coloring and the defense of difficult causes, and some even on the acknowledgment of guilt, unless, at times, the force and ingenuity of eloquence overpowers even truth itself? For a good man advocates only good causes, and truth itself supports them sufficiently without the aid of learning." These objectors I shall endeavor to satisfy by answering them, first, concerning my own work, and, secondly, concerning the duty of a good man if occasion ever calls him to the defense of the guilty.
>
> To consider how we may speak in defense of what is false, or even what is unjust, is not without its use, if for no other reason than we may expose and refute fallacious arguments with the greater ease. (XII.i.33-34)
---
## Cradle to Grave

> AFTER displaying these excellences of eloquence on trials, in councils, at the assemblies of the people, in the senate, and in every province of a good citizen, the orator will think of bringing his labors to an end worthy of an honorable man and a noble employment, not because it is ever time to leave off doing good or because it is improper for one endowed with such understanding and talents to spend the longest possible time in so dignified an occupation, but because it becomes him to take care that he may not speak worse than he has been in the habit of speaking. The orator does not depend merely on knowledge, which increases with years, but on strength of voice, lungs, and constitution, and if these are weakened or impaired by age or ill health, he must beware lest something of his usual excellence is missed, lest he should be obliged to stop from fatigue, lest he should perceive that what he says is imperfectly heard, and lest he should not recognize his former in his present self. (XII.xi.1-2)
---
## Final Thoughts

> Let us then pursue, with our whole powers, the true dignity of eloquence, nothing better than which has been given to mankind by the immortal gods. Without it, all nature would be mute and all our acts would be deprived alike of present honor and of commemoration among posterity. Therefore, let us aspire to the highest excellence, for by this means, we shall either attain the summit or at least see many below us.
>
> Such are the observations, Marcellus Victor, from which I thought the art of oratory might, as far as was in my power, derive some assistance from me. Attention to what I have said, if it does not bring great advantage to studious youth, will at least excite in them what I desire even more—a love for doing well. (XII.xi.31-32)
