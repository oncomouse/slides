    ## Discussion Leader (Haley)
    
    > For there are many who study only to become ignorant, especially those of arrogant, restless, and prideful spirits, fond of innovations in the Law (the very thing that rejects all innovation). And so they are not content until, for the sake of saying what no one before them has said, they speak heresy. Of such men as these the Holy Spirit says: “For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul.” For them, more harm is worked by knowledge than by ignorance. A wit once observed that he who knows no Latin is not an utter fool, but he who does know it has met the prerequisites. And I might add that he is made a perfect fool (if foolishness can attain perfection) by having studied his bit of philosophy and theology and by knowing something of languages. For with that he can be foolish in several sciences and tongues; a great fool cannot be contained in his mother tongue alone. (81)
    
    Does having the knowledge of more than one subject make someone less foolish? Or can someone more knowledgeable be considered more foolish than someone who knows less? Do you believe this line to be accurate today?

    ## Discussion Question (Maria)
    
    > The venerable Dr. Arce (worthy professor of Scripture, known for his virtue and learning), in his For the Scholar of the Bible, raises this question: “Is it permissible for women to apply themselves to the study, and indeed the interpretation, of the Holy Bible?” And in opposition he presents the verdicts passed by many saints, particularly the words of [Paul] the Apostle: “Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak,”...Arce at last resolves, in his prudent way, that women are not allowed to lecture publicly in the universities or to preach from the pulpits, but that studying, writing, and teaching privately is not only permitted but most beneficial and useful to them. Clearly, of course, he does not mean by this that all women should do so, but only those whom God may have seen fit to endow with special virtue and prudence, and who are very mature and erudite and possess the necessary talents and requirements for such a sacred occupation. (81)
    
    In this passage, we see how De la Cruz uses some of the same biblical references that Fell used in her discussion. However, De la Cruz takes a different approach. Is her different approach stronger or weaker than Fell's? Why might each women use a different approach? Additionally, these two women are combating the same issue. Today, what issue do you think women combat, and how can we use the techniques (rhetorical devices) De la Cruz (and Fell) use to combat these issues?

    ## Poetry (Poem #164)
    
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, my darling, when we spoke,  
    > and in your face and gestures I could see  
    > that I was not persuading you with words,  
    > I wished you might look straight into my heart;  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Love, who was assisting my designs,  
    > succeeded in what seemed impossible:  
    > for in the stream of tears which anguish loosed  
    > my heart itself, dissolved, dropped slowly down.  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough unkindness now, my love, enough;  
    > don’t let these tyrant jealousies torment you  
    > nor base suspicious shatter your repose  
    > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with foolish shadows, empty evidence:  
    > in liquid humor you have seen and touched  
    > my heart undone and passing through your hands.

    ## Opening
    
    > If studies, my lady, be merits (for indeed I see them extolled as such in men), in me they are no such thing: I study because I must. If they be a failing, I believe for the same reason that the fault is none of mine. Yet withal, I live always so wary of myself that neither in this nor in anything else do I trust my own judgment. and so I entrust the decision to your supreme skill and straightway submit to whatever sentence you may pass, posing no objection or reluctance, for this has been no more than a sim-ple account of my inclination to letters.

    ## Prior Precedent / Novelty
    
    > Arce at last resolves, in his prudent way, that women are not allowed to lecture publicly in the universities or to preach from the pulpits, but that studying, writing, and teaching privately is not only permitted but most beneficial and useful to them. Clearly, of course, he does not mean by this that all women should do so, but only those whom God may have seen fit to endow with special virtue and prudence, and who are very mature and erudite and possess the necessary talents and requirements for such a sacred occupation. and so just is this distinction that not only women, who are held to be so incompetent, but also men, who simply because they are men think themselves wise, are to be prohibited from the interpretation of the Sacred word, save when they are most learned, virtuous, of amenable intellect and inclined to the good. For when the reverse is true, I believe, numerous sectarians are produced, and this has given rise to numerous heresies. For there are many who study only to become ignorant, especially those of arrogant, rest-less, and prideful spirits, fond of innovations in the law (the very thing that rejects all innovation). and so they are not content until, for the sake of saying what no one before them has said, they speak heresy.

    ## More Harm From Knowledge
    
    > For them, more harm is worked by knowledge than by ignorance. A wit once observed that he who knows no latin is not an utter fool, but he who does know it has met the prerequisites, and I might add that he is made a perfect fool (if foolishness can attain perfection) by having studied his bit of philosophy and theology and by knowing something of languages.

    ## Learning: *Pharmakon*?
    
    > To such men, I repeat, study does harm, because it is like putting a sword in the hands of a madman: though the sword be the noblest of instruments for defense, in his hands it becomes his own death and that of many others. this is what the divine letters became in the hands of that wicked Pelagius and of the perverse Arius, of that wicked Luther, and all the other heretics, like our own Dr. Cazalla (who was never either our own nor a doctor). learning harmed them all, though it can be the best nourishment and life for the soul. For just as an infirm stomach, suffering from diminished heat, produces more bitter, putrid, and perverse humors the better the food that it is given, so too these evil persons give rise to worse opinions the more they study. their understanding is obstructed by the very thing that should nourish it, and the fact is they study a great deal and digest very little, failing to measure their efforts to the narrow vessel of their understanding.

    ## Natural Ability
    
    > If I wish to know as much as or more than Aristotle or St. Augustine, but I lack the ability of a St. Augustine or an Aristotle, then I may study more than both of them together, but I shall not only fail to reach my goal: I shall weaken and stupefy the workings of my feeble understanding with such a disproportionate aim.

    ## Imperfection
    
    > Oh, that all men—and I, who am but an ignorant woman, first of all—might take the measure of our abilities before setting out to study and, what is worse, to write, in our jealous aspiration to equal and even surpass others. How little boldness would we summon, how many errors might we avoid, and how many distorted interpretations now noised abroad should be noised no further! and I place my own before all others, for if I knew all that I ought, I would not so much as write these words. Yet I protest that I do so only to obey you; and with such misgiving that you owe me more for taking up my pen with all this fear than you would owe me were I to present you with the most perfect works. But withal, it is well that this goes to meet with your correction: erase it, tear it up, and chastise me, for I shall value that more than all the vain applause others could give me. (83)

    ## The Need for Educated Women
    
    > Oh, how many abuses would be avoided in our land if the older women were as well instructed as leta and knew how to teach as is commanded by St. Paul and my father St. Jerome! Instead, for lack of such learning and through the extreme feebleness in which they are determined to maintain our poor women, if any parents then wish to give their daughters more extensive christian instruction than is usual, necessity and the lack of learned older women oblige them to employ men as instructors to teach read-ing and writing, numbers and music, and other skills. this leads to considerable harm, which occurs every day in doleful instances of these unsuitable associations. For the immediacy of such con-tact and the passage of time all too frequently allow what seemed impossible to be accomplished quite easily. For this reason, many parents prefer to let their daughters remain uncivilized and un-tutored, rather than risk exposing them to such notorious peril as this familiarity with men. Yet all this could be avoided if there were old women of sound education, as St. Paul desires, so that instruction could be passed from the old to the young just as is done with sewing and all the customary skills.

    ## Logic
    
    > All this requires more study than is supposed by certain men who, as mere grammarians or, at most, armed with four terms from the principles of logic, wish to interpret the Scriptures and cling to the “Let women keep silence in the churches,” without know-ing how to understand it rightly. So it is with another passage, “Let the woman learn in silence”; for this passage is more in favor of than against women, as it says that they should learn, and while they are learning, obviously, they must needs keep quiet. And it is also written, “Hear, O Israel, and be silent,” where the whole congregation of men and women are addressed, and all are told to be quiet, for whoever listens and learns has good reason to take heed and keep still. If this be not so, I would like these interpreters and expounders of St. Paul to explain to me how they understand the passage, “Let women keep silence in the churches.” For they must understand it either materially, to mean the pulpit and the lecture hall, or formally, to mean the community of all believers, which is to say the Church. If they understand it in the first sense (which is to my way of thinking its true sense, for we can see that indeed it is not permitted by the church for women to read publicly or to preach), why then do they rebuke those women who study in private? and if they understand it in the second sense and wish to extend the apostle’s prohibition to all instances without exception, so that not even in private may women write or study, then how is it that we see the church has allowed a Gertrude, a Teresa, a Brigid, the nun of Agreda, and many other women to write? And if they tell me that these women all were saintly, true enough, but that in no way hinders my argument. First, because St. Paul’s proposition is absolute and includes all women with no exception made for saints; (89-91)

    ## Scholar vs Theologian
    
    > Is my mind, such as it is, less free than his, though it derives from the same source? Is his opinion to be taken as one of the principles of the Holy Faith made manifest, that we must believe it blindly? Besides which, I have not in the slightest way fallen short of that respect owed such a great man, as his defender has done in this instance, forgetting the observation of Titus Lucius, “Respect befits the arts.” nor did I so much as graze the hem of the blessed Society. nor did I write for anyone other than the person who suggested it to me; and according to Pliny, “The situation of one who publishes a thing is different from that of one who speaks it by name.” For had I thought the letter was to be published, it would not have appeared as unkempt as it was. If it is heretical, as the critic says, why does he not denounce it? thus he would find revenge and I contentment, for I more greatly value, as I ought, the name of Catholic and obedient daughter of my Holy Mother Church than any praise that might befall me as a scholar. If the letter be crude—as he rightly says it is—then let him laugh at it, though he laugh falsely with what they call rabbit’s laughter. I do not say that he should praise me, for just as I was free to disagree with Vieira, any person shall be free to disagree with my judgment. (93)</textarea>
