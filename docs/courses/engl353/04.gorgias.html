## Encomium

> Praise is the expression in words of the eminence of a man's good qualities, and therefore we must display his actions as the product of such qualities. Encomium refers to what he has actually done; the mention of accessories, such as good birth and education, merely helps to make our story credible -- good fathers are likely to have good sons, and good training is likely to produce good character. Hence it is only when a man has already done something that we bestow encomiums upon him. Yet the actual deeds are evidence of the doer's character: even if a man has not actually done a given good thing, we shall bestow praise on him, if we are sure that he is the sort of man who would do it. To call any one blest is, it may be added, the same thing as to call him happy; but these are not the same thing as to bestow praise and encomium upon him; the two latter are a part of "calling happy," just as goodness is a part of happiness. (Aristotle, *Rhetoric*, Book I, Chapter 9)

## Style

**1.** What is becoming to a city is manpower, to a body beauty, to a soul wisdom, to an action virtue, to a speech truth, and the opposite of these are unbecoming. Man and woman in speech and deed and city and object should be honored with praise if praiseworthy and incur blame it on worthy, for it is unequal error and mistake to blame the praiseable and praise the blamable. (George A Kennedy, 1972)

**1.** Embellishment to a city is the valor of its citizens; to a person, comeliness; to a soul, wisdom; to a deed, virtue; to discourse, truth. But the opposite to these is lack of embellishment. Now a man, woman, discourse, work, city, deed, if deserving of praise must be honored with praise, but if undeserving must be censured. For it is alike aberration and stultification to censure the commendable and commend the censurable. ([LaRue Van Hook, 1919](https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4386697/4386697_djvu.txt))

**1.** Fairest ornament to a city is a goodly army and to a body beauty and to a soul wisdom and to an action virtue and to a speech truth, but there opposites are unbefitting. Man and woman and speech and deed and city and object should be honored with praise if praiseworthy, but on the unworthy blame should be laid; for it is equal error and ignorance to blame the praiseworthy and to praise the blameworthy. (George A Kennedy, 1990)

## Style (Novelty)

They are antithesis, paronomasia, alliteration, repetition of words, likeness of sound in final syllables of successive words and clauses, and arrangement of words in nearly equal periods. Add to these, alternating amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets. (Van Hook)

1. Likeness of sound in final syllabes (examples)
	* [in 2] "But I desire by rational calculation to free the lady's reputation"
	* [in 4] "all came because of amorous contention and ambitious pretention"
	* [in 7] "meet with verbal accusation, legal reprobation and actual condemnation"

## Style + Power

> But if speech (*logos*) persuaded her and deceived her soul, not even to this is it difficult to make answer and to banish blame, as follows. Speech is a powerful lord that with the smallest and most invisible body accomplishes most godlike works. It can banish fear and remove grief and instill pleasure and enhance pity â€¦ All poetry I regard and name as speech having meter. On those who hear it come fearful shuddering and tearful pity and grievous longing, as the soul, through words, experiences some experience of its own at others' good fortune and ill fortune. (253-4)

## Novelty & Reason

> Thus, I shall refute those who rebuke Helen, a woman about whom there is univocal and unanimous testimony among those who have believed the poets and whose ill-omened name has become a memorial of disasters. I wish, by giving some logic to language, to free the accused of blame and to show that her critics are lying and to demonstrate the truth and to put an end to ignorance. (252)

Using reason to confront myth/opinion (*doxa*)

## Reason (Structure of Argument)

Four Reasons for Helen's Reputation:

1. Love
1. Violence
1. Persuasion
1. Divine Intervention

---
class: f34px
## Persuasion (Magic)

> Divine sweetness transmitted through words is inductive of pleasure, reductive of pain. Thus, by entering into the opinion of the soul the force of incantation is wont to beguile and persuade and alter it by witchcraft, and the two arts of witchcraft and magic are errors of the soul and deceivers of opinion. How many speakers on how many subjects have persuaded others and continue to persuade by molding false speech? (254)

---
class: f31px
## Persuasion (Opinion)

> If everyone, on every subject, had memory of the past and knowledge of the present and foresight of the future, speech would not do what it does; but as things are, it is easy neither to remember the past nor consider the present nor to predict the future; so that on most subjects most people take opinion as counselor to the soul. But opinion, being slippery and insecure, casts those relying on it into slippery and insecure fortune. What is there to present the conclusion that Helen, too, when still young, was carried off by speech just as constrained by force? (254)

---
class: f37px

## Persuaded

> Her mind was swept away by persuasion, and persuasion has the same power as necessity, although it may bring shame; for speech, by persuading the soul that it persuaded, constrained her both to obey what was said and to approve what was done. The persuader, as user of force, did wrong; the persuaded, forced by speech, is unreasonably blamed. (254)
---
class: f27px

## Persuasion

> To understand that persuasion, joining with speech, is wont to stamp the soul as it wishes, one must study, first, the words of the astronomers who, substituting opinion for opinion, removing one and instilling another, make incredible and unclear things appear true to the eyes of opinion; second, forceful speeches in public debate, where one side of the argument pleases a large crowd and persuades by being written with art even though not spoken from trut; third, the verbal wrangling of philosophers in which, too, a swiftness of thought is exhibited, making confidence in opinion easily changed. The power of speech has the same effect on the condition of the soul as the application of drugs to the state of the body. (254)

---
class: f27px

## The Conclusion?

> How, then, can blame thought just? Whether she did what she did by falling in love or persuaded by speech or seized by violence or forced by divine necessity, she is completely acquitted. By speech I have removed disgrace from a woman. I have abided by the principle I posed at the start of my speech: I have tried to refute the injustice defamation and the ignorance of allegation. I wished to write a speech that would be Helen's encomium and my own *paignion* ["ie. plaything, amusement"] (255-6)

1. Is this a speech praising Helen?
1. What does Gorgias mean by "plaything"?
