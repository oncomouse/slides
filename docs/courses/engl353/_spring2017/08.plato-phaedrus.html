# Plato, *Phaedrus*

## Discussion Leader (Colin)
> SOCRATES: Won’t someone who is to speak well and nobly have to have in mind the truth about the subject he is going to discuss?
>
> PHAEDRUS: I have actually heard … that it is not necessary for the intending orator to learn what is really just, but only what will seem just to the crowd who will act as judges. Nor again what is really good or noble, but only what will seem so. For this is what persuasion proceeds from, not truth. (260a)

1. Why might one, such as Phaedrus be driven to skepticism regarding speeches and the orator delivering them?
1. In what ways is persuasion potentially dangerous?

## Discussion Leader (Cierra)
> SOCRATES: But could it be, my friend, that we have mocked the art of speaking more rudely than it deserves? For it might perhaps reply, "What bizarre nonsense! Look, I am not forcing any one to learn how to make speeches without knowing the truth; on the contrary, my advice, for what it is worth is to take me up only after mastering the truth. But I do make this boast: even someone who knows the truth couldn’t produce conviction on the basis of a systematic art without me." (260d)

How is this moment significant in comparison to the other criticisms we've seen of sophist rhetoric? From a socratic perspective, what is the role of rhetoric in relation to truth?

## What Makes a Speech Good?

> SOCRATES: Won't someone who is to speak well and nobly have to have in mind the truth about the subject he is about to discuss?
>
> PHAEDRUS: What I have actually heard about this, Socrates, my friend, **is that it is not necessary for the intending orator to learn what is really just**, but only what will seem just to the crowd who will act as judges. (259e-260a)

## Rhetoric and Conviction

> SOCRATES: For [rhetoric] might perhaps reply, "What bizarre nonsense! Look, I am not forcing anyone to learn how to make speeches without knowing the truth; on the contrary, my advice, for what it is worth, is to take me up only after mastering the truth. But I do make this boast: even someone who knows the truth couldn't produce conviction on the basis of a systematic art without me." (260d)

## Directing the Soul

> SOCRATES: Well, then, isn't the rhetorical art, taken as a whole, a way of directing the soul by means of speech, not only in the lawcourts and on other public occasions but also in private? Isn't it one and the same art whether its subject is great or small, and no more to be held in esteem—if it is followed correctly—when its questions are serious than when they are trivial? Or what have you heard about all this?
>
> PHAEDRUS: Well, certainly not what *you* have! Artful speaking and writing is found mainly in the lawcourts; also perhaps in the Assembly. That's all I've heard.
>
> SOCRATES: Well, have you only heard of the rhetorical treatises of Nestor and Odysseus—those they wrote in their spare time in Troy? Haven't you also heard of the works of Palamedes? (261a-b)

## *Eidos* and the Directed Soul

> SOCRATES: When someone utters the words "iron" or "silver," don't we all think of the same thing? ...
>
> SOCRATES: But what happens when we say "just" or "good"? Doesn't each one of us go in a different direction? Don't we differ with one another and even with ourselves? ...
>
> SOCRATES: Therefore, we agree about the former and disagree about the latter. ...
>
> SOCRATES: Now in which of these two cases are we most easily deceived? And when does rhetoric have greater power?
>
> PHAEDRUS: Clearly, when we wander in different directions.
>
> SOCRATES: It follows that whoever wants to acquire the art of rhetoric must first make systematic division and grasp the particular character of each of these two kinds of thing, both the kind where most people wander in different directions and the kind where they do not. (263a-b)

## Socrates the Sophist

> SOCRATES: Well, now, what shall we say about love? Does it belong to the class where people differ or to that where they don't?
>
> PHAEDRUS: Oh, surely the class where they differ. Otherwise, do you think you could have spoken of it as you did a few minutes ago, first saying that it is harmful both to lover and beloved and then immediately afterward that it is the greatest good?
>
> SOCRATES: Very well put. But now tell me this—I can't remember at all because I was completely possessed by the gods: Did I define love at the beginning of my speech?
>
> PHAEDRUS: Oh, absolutely, by Zeus, you most certainly did.
>
> SOCRATES: Alas, how much more artful with speeches the Nymphs, daughters of Achelous, and Pan, son of Hermes, are, according to what you say, than Lysias, son of Cephalus! (263c-d)

## Directed Soul at Work

> SOCRATES: Since the nature of speech is in fact to direct the soul, whoever intends to be a rhetorician must know how many kinds of soul there are. Their number is so-and-so many; each is of such-and-such a sort; hence some people have such-and-such a character and others have such-and-such. Those distinctions established, there are, in turn, so-and-so many kinds of speech, each of such-and-such a sort. People of such-and-such a character are easy to persuade by speeches of such-and-such a sort in connection with such-and-such an issue for this particular reason, while people of such-and-such another sort are difficult to persuade for those particular reasons.
>
> The orator must learn all this well, then put his theory into practice and develop the ability to discern each kind clearly as it occurs in the actions of real life. Otherwise, he won't be any better off than he was when he was still listening to those discussions in school. (271d-e)

## Thamus and Theuth (on writing)

> SOCRATES: Thamus, however, replied: "O most expert Theuth, one man can give birth to the elements of an art, but only another can judge how they can benefit or harm those who will use them. And now, since you are the father of writing, your affection for it has made you describe its effects as the opposite of what they really are. In fact, it will introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember for the inside, completely on their own. You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide yours students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many things without being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to know much while for the most part they will know nothing. And they will be difficult to get along with, since they will appear to be wise instead of really being so." (275a-b)

## Other Voices

> SOCRATES: But, my friend, the priests of the temple of Zeus at Dodona say that the first prophecies were the words of an oak. Everyone who lived at that time, not being as wise as you young ones are today, found it rewarding enough in their simplicity to listen to an oak or even a stone, so long as it was telling the truth, while it seems to make a difference to you, Phaedrus, who is speaking and where he comes from. Why, though, don't you just consider whether what he says is right or wrong? (275b-c)

## Writing and Kairos

> SOCRATES: how could they possibly think that words that have been written down can do more than remind those who already know what the writing is about? (275c-d)

> SOCRATES: When it has once been written down, every discourse roams about everywhere, reaching indiscriminately those with understanding no less than those who have no business with it, and it doesn't know to whom it should speak and to whom it should not. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father's support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support. (275e)
---
class: f26px
## Writing and the Soul

> SOCRATES: Now tell me, can we discern another kind of discourse, a legitimate brother of this one? Can we say how it comes about, and how it is by nature better and more capable?
>
> PHAEDRUS: Which one is that? How do you think it comes about?
> 
> SOCRATES: It is a discourse that is written down, with knowledge, in the soul of the listener; it can defend itself, and it knows for whom it should speak and for whom it should remain silent.
>
> PHAEDRUS: You mean the living, breathing discourse of the man who knows, of which the written one can be fairly called an image. (276a)

class: f34px
## Writing and Knowledge

> SOCRATES: If any one of you has composed these things with a knowledge of the truth, if you can defend your writing when you are challenged, and if you can yourself make the argument that your writing is of little worth, then you must be called by a name derived not from these writings but rather from those things that you are seriously pursuing. (278c-d)
