## The Three Styles: Plain

> The best chain saws are formidable and dangerous tools. My brother nearly cut off his arm with one. A neighbor who earns his living in timber just managed to kill the engine on his when he was cutting overhead and a branch snapped the saw back toward him. The chain did not stop running until it had cut through the beak of his cap. He was very solemn when I told him that I had bought my own chain saw, and he gave me a good piece of advice. “The time to worry about a chain saw,” he said, “is when you stop being afraid of it.”
>
> I am cautious. I spend a lot of time sizing up a tree before I fell it. Once it is down, I clear away the surrounding brush before I start cutting it into lengths. That way I will not trip and lose my balance with the saw running. A dull chain and a poorly running saw are dangerous, so I’ve learned to keep mine in good shape and I sharpen the chain each time I use it. (Hubbell 202 qtd in *PP*)

## The Three Styles: Middle

> We are a wandering species, and have been since we reared up on our hind legs and stared at the horizon. Our impulse to wander, to pick up and move when things no longer suit us in our present place, is not an ailment brought on suddenly by industrialization, by science, or by the European hegemony over dark-skinned peoples. It would be naïve to think that Spanish horses corrupted the Plains Indians, tempting a sedentary people to rush about, or that snowmobiles corrupted the Inuit, or that Jeeps corrupted the Aborigines. It would be just as naïve to say that the automobile gave rise to our own restlessness; on the contrary our restlessness gave rise to the automobile, as it led to the bicycle, steamboat, and clipper ship, as it led to the taming of horses, lacing of snowshoes, and carving of dugout canoes. With each invention, a means of moving farther, faster, has answered to a desire that coils in our genes. Mobility is the rule in human history, rootedness the exception.

## The Three Styles: High

> What happens to us when all the sacred, all the whole is gone—when there is no more whole? There will be only fragments of stories, fragments of culture, fragments of integrity. Even a child standing on the porch in Houston with the rain in his face can look north and know that it is all tied together, that we are the warblers, we are the zonetails, we are the underground river; that it is all holy, and that some of it should not be allowed to disappear, as has so much, and so many of us, already.

## The Opening

> When as often happens, brother Quintus, I think over and recall the days of old, those men always seem to me to have been singularly happy who, with the State at her best, and while enjoying high distinctions and the fame of their achievements, were able to maintain such a course of life that they could either engage in activity that involved no risk or enjoy a dignified repose. And time was when I used to imagine that I too should become entitled, with wellnigh universal approval, to some opportunity of leisure and of again directing my mind to the sublime pursuits beloved of us both, when once, the career of office complete and life too taking the turn toward its close, the endless toil of public speaking and the business of canvassing should have come to a standstill (I.i)
---
class: f30px
## The Liberal Arts

> As for ability again—there are many things to show it—our fellow-countrymen have far excelled the men of every other race. And considering all this, who would not rightly marvel that, in all the long record of ages, times, and states, so small a number of orators is to be found?
>
> But the truth is that this oratory is a greater thing, and has its sources in more arts and branches of study, than people suppose (I.iv)
---
class: f32px
## Queen Rhetorica

> To begin with, a knowledge of very many matters must be grasped, without which oratory is but an empty and ridiculous swirl of verbiage: and the distinctive style has to be formed, not only by the choice of words, but also by the arrangement of the same; and all the mental emotions, with which nature has endowed the human race, are to be intimately understood, because it is in calming or kindling the feelings of the audience that the full power and science of oratory are to be brought into play. (I.v)
---
class: f30px
## Rhetoric as Civic Virtue (Crassus)

> Or what achievement so mighty and glorious as that the impulses of the crowd, the consciences of the judges, the austerity of the Senate, should suffer transformation through the eloquence of one man? What function again is so kingly, so worthy of the free, so generous, as to bring help to the suppliant, to raise up those cast down, to bestow security, to set free from peril, to maintain men in their civil rights? What too is so indispensable as to have always in your grasp weapons wherewith you can defend yourself, or challenge the wicked man, or when provoked take your revenge? (I.viii)
---
class: f32px
## Rhetoric and Ruination (Scaevola)

> His sons, on the other hand, who were accomplished speakers and equipped for oratory with every advantage of nature or training, after they had taken over a State that was flourishing exceedingly because of their father's counsels and their ancestors' military achievements, wrecked the commonwealth by use of this eloquence to which, according to you, civil communities still look for their chief guidance. (I. ix)
---
class: f24px
## Gorgias? (Crassus)

> For never will I say that there are not certain arts belonging exclusively to those who have employed all their energies in the mastery and exercise thereof, but my assertion will be that the complete and finished orator is he who on any matter whatever can speak with fullness and variety.
>
> Indeed in handling those causes which everybody acknowledges to be within the exclusive sphere of oratory, there is not seldom something to be brought forth and employed, not from practice in public speaking—the only thing you allow an orator—but from some more abstruse branch of knowledge. I ask, for instance, whether an advocate can either assail or defend a commander-in-chief without experience of the art of war, sometimes too without knowledge of the various regions of land or sea? (I.xiii-xiv)
---
class: f34px
## Skill vs Career (Crassus)

> Remember that I have not been speaking of my own skill, but of that of an orator. For what have men like myself either learned or had any chance of knowing, who entered upon practice before ever we reached the study of theory, whom our professional activities in public speaking, in the pursuit of office, in politics, and about the affairs of our friends, wore out ere we could form any conception of the importance of these other matters? (I.xvii)
---
class: f33px
## The Ideal Orator

> But since it is 'The Orator' we are seeking, we have to picture to ourselves in our discourse an orator from whom every blemish has been taken away, and one who moreover is rich in every merit. For even though the multiplicity of litigation, the diversity of issues, and the rabble of rusticity thronging our public places, give opportunity even to the most faulty speakers, we shall not for that reason lose sight of this our objective. (I.xxvi)
---
class: f23px
## *Imitatio* (Antonius)

> Let this then be my first counsel, that we show the student whom to copy, and to copy in such a way as to strive with all possible care to attain the most excellent qualities of his model. Next let practice be added, whereby in copying he may reproduce the pattern of his choice and not portray him as time and again I have known many copyists do, who in copying hunt after such characteristics as are easily copied or even abnormal and possibly faulty. For nothing is easier than to imitate a man's style of dress, pose or gait. Moreover, if there is a fault, it is not much trouble to appropriate that and to copy it ostentatiously, just as that Fufius, who even now is raving in the political world, though his voice has gone, fails to attain the energy in speaking which Gaius Fimbria certainly possessed, though hitting off his uncouth mouthings and broad pronunciation, For all that, however, he did not know how to choose the model whom he would most willingly resemble, and it was positively the faults in his chosen pattern that he elected to copy. (II.xxii)
---
class: f32px
## Gifted Individuals (Antonius)

> But what little I can do in this direction can be judged from my financial situation, and in the other from what I say. And indeed we see that there are many who copy no man, but gain their objects by natural aptitude, without resembling any model. And the truth of this may be observed in you two, Caesar and Cotta, for one of you has acquired a degree of humor and wit unusual in orators, at any rate in our own, and the other a thoroughly keen and subtle type of oratory. (II.xxii)
---
class: f33px
## Novelty is Gone?

> It is related that Gorgias of Leontini was the author of this practice, who was thought to be undertaking and professing something very magnificent when he advertised himself as ready for any topic whatever on which anyone might have a fancy to hear him. Later, however, they began to do this everywhere, and are doing it to this day, with the result of there being no theme so vast, so unforeseen, or so novel, that they do not claim to be prepared to say about it all that there is to be said. (I.xxii)
---
class: f22px
## Precedent as Rhetoric (Antonius)

> However, to introduce at last this man we are portraying to the business of trials and lawsuits, especially such cases as involve rather more trouble,—someone will perhaps laugh at this axiom, for it is not so much shrewd as necessary, and comes from an adviser who is no fool, rather than from a learned Master—we shall first instruct him to get up carefully and thoroughly whatever cases he proposes to conduct. This is no canon of the schools, for the cases set to the boys are simple. ' Statute forbids a foreigner to mount the wall ; a foreigner mounts ; he has driven ofF the enemy ; he is prosecuted.' It is no trouble to get up a case like that, and so they are right in giving no directions for mastering the case, for this is just about the type of wording in cases set in the schools. But in the law-courts documents, evidence, informal agreements, formal contracts, relationship by blood or marriage, magisterial orders, opinions of counsel, and finally the life-history of the parties to the proceedings, must all be examined; and we see that it is generally through neglect of these matters that cases are lost, particularly such as concern private rights, for these are often of peculiar difficulty. (II.xxiv)
---
class: f32px
## Three Heads 1 & 2  (Antonius)

> Thus in Court the first class of cases is that of disputed facts; debate generally proceeds from something still to come, seldom from anything present or past.
>
> Often too the question is not whether something be the fact or not, but what is its nature; as, when I heard Gaius Carbo, in his consulship, defending Lucius Opimius before the people, he denied no detail of the killing of Gaius Gracchus, but urged that it was justifiable and for the public safety ... (II.xxv)
---
class: f20px, no-margin
## Three Heads 3 (Antonius)

> Again the question is one of definition, when the terms in which an act should be described are in dispute, as in the main contention between myself and our friend Sulpicius at the trial of Norbanus. For, while admitting most of our friend's indictment, I still maintained that the defendant was not guilty of 'treason,' since the whole case depended on the construction of this word, by virtue of the Statute of Appuleius. And in such proceedings some lay down a rule that each side shall concisely define the debatable term, a proposition which I myself always think thoroughly childish. For definition of terms is another thing when controversy arises among specialists touching the intimate concerns of the arts, for instance when inquiry is made as to the essential nature of an art, a statute or a community, in which circumstances scientific method ordains that the significance of whatever you are defining shall be made plain, with no omission or redundance. But in that case of ours Sulpicius did no such thing nor did I attempt it, since we both, to the utmost of our power, enlarged with all our fluency upon the meaning of 'act of treason.' For, in the first place, if the addition or substraction of a word be seized on, a definition is often wrung from our grasp, and then too the very suggestion savours of the schools and a training little better than elementary, and lastly the definition cannot reach the understanding and reason of the arbitrator, as it slips by him before he has taken it in. (II.xxv)

class: f27px
## Three Objects (Antonius)

> But to return at length to my own plan. As soon then as I have received my instructions and the case and taken the matter in hand, the very first thing I determine is that point to which I must devote all such part of my speech as belongs peculiarly to the issue and the verdict. Next I contemplate with the utmost care those other two essentials, the one involving the recommendation of myself or my clients, the other designed to sway the feelings of the tribunal in the desired direction. Thus for purposes of persuasion the art of speaking relies wholly upon three things: the proof of our allegations, the winning of our hearers' favour, and the rousing of their feelings to whatever impulse our case may require. (II.xxvii)
---
class: f21px, no-margin
## Dialectic?

> do you observe that..., it was Diogenes who claimed to be teaching an art of speaking well, and of distinguishing truth from error, which art he called by the Greek name of dialectic? This art, if indeed it be an art, contains no directions for discovering truth, but only for testing it. For as to every proposition that we enunciate with an affirmation of its truth or falsity, if it be affirmed without qualification, the dialecticians undertake to decide whether it be true or false; and, if again it be stated hypothetically, with collateral propositions annexed, then they decide whether these others are properly annexed, and whether the conclusion drawn from each and every reasoning is correct: and in the end they prick themselves with their own barbs, and by wide investigation discover not only difficulties such as they themselves can no longer solve, but also others by which webs already attacked, or rather well-nigh unwound, are tangled up again. In this connexion then that eminent Stoic is of no help to us, since he does not teach me how to discover what to say; and he actually hinders me, by finding many difficulties which he pronounces quite insoluble, and by introducing a kind of diction that is not lucid, copious and flowing, but meagre, spiritless, cramped and paltry; and, if any man commends this style, it will only be with the qualification that it is unsuitable to an orator. (II.xxxviii)
---
class: f27px
## Aristotle

> And between this Aristotle ... and these true professors of this art, there seemed to me to be this difference,—that he surveyed these concerns of the art of rhetoric, which he disdained, with that same keen insight, by which he had dis- cerned the essential nature of all things ; whereas those others, considering this the only thing worth cultivating, have dwelt upon the treatment of this single subject, without his sagacity, but, in this one instance, with larger practice and closer application. As for Carneades, however, the extraordinary power and diversity of his oratory would be extremely to our liking; since, in those debates of his he supported no contention without proving it, and attacked none which he did not overthrow. (II.xxxviii)
