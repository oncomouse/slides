## Role of Repetition

>(1) A very great and most attractive discovery that has been made for the way we live is [the power of] memory; it is useful for all purposes, for both general education and practical wisdom.
>
>(2) This is true, [as you will see] if you concentrate your attention [upon the matter]. For by following this course your mind will come to perceive more 'as a whole' that which you have learned.
>
>(3) Second, you must, whenever you hear anything, go over it carefully. For by frequent repetition of what you hear you commit it to memory.
>
>(4) Third, you must, whenever you hear anything, connect it to what you know, as in the following example: you need to remember the name Chrysippus? Then you ought to connect it with χρυσός
>(gold) and ίππος (horse). (9.1-4, 141-143)

## Education

> (12) And if someone is not convinced that we learn our words, but feels sure we are born knowing them, let him ascertain the truth from the following evidence: should a person send a child to Persia immediately it was born and have it brought up there without ever hearing the speech of Greece, the child would speak Persian; should one bring the child from Persia to Greece, the child would speak Greek. That is the way we learn words, and we do not know who it was who taught us. (6.12, 135)
