# Plato, *Euthyphro*

> SOCRATES: Is not this, Euthyphro, the reason why I am being prosecuted, because when people tell such stories about the gods I find it hard to accept them? And therefore, probably, people will say I am wrong. Now if you, who know so much about such things, accept these tales, I suppose I too must give way. For what am I to say, who confess frankly that I know nothing about them? But tell me, in the name of Zeus, the god of friendship, do you really believe these things happened?
>
> EUTHYPHRO: Yes, and still more wonderful things than these, Socrates, which most people do not know.

Clearly Socrates does not believe in the stories of the gods. As we have discussed, the Greeks believed that anything that could be thought existed. Socrates, in the case of this indictment by Meletus, is accused of not believing in the gods and preaching heresy. While this is an attack on their fundamental belief system it was also an attack on the Greek imagination. With this in mind, what was Socrates really on trial for: Religious heresy, or his ability to undermine the Greek thought process?

> EUTHYPHRO: Yes, and still more wonderful things than these, Socrates, which most people do not know.

> SOCRATES: And so you believe that there was really war between the gods, and fearful enmities and battles and other things of the sort, such as are told of by the poets and represented in varied designs by the great artists in our sacred places and especially on the robe which is carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea? for this is covered with such representations. Shall we agree that these things are true, Euthyphro?

> EUTHYPHRO: Not only these things, Socrates; but, as I said just now, I will, if you like, tell you many other ‘things about the gods, which I am sure will amaze you when you hear them.

## Discussion Leader (Daisy)
Throughout the reading Socrates is trying to get Euthyphro to establish what is and what isn’t holy. How does this debate resemble issues that are currently occurring? Would you make the argument that we’ve been able to establish a moral code or that it continues to be an abstract idea?

## Trial & Death

class: f30px
## Setting & Character

>EUTHYPHRO: What strange thing has happened, Socrates, that you have left your accustomed haunts in the Lyceum and are now haunting the portico where the king archon sits? For it cannot be that you have an action before the king, as I have.
>
>SOCRATES: Our Athenians, Euthyphro, do not call it an action, but an indictment.
>
>EUTHYPHRO: What? Somebody has, it seems, brought an indictment against you; for I don’t accuse you of having brought one against anyone else. (2a-b)
---
class: f30px
## *daimonion*

> SOCRATES: Absurd things, my friend, at first hearing. For he says I am a maker of gods; and because I make new gods and do not believe in the old ones, he indicted me for the sake of these old ones, as he says.
>
> EUTHYPHRO: I understand, Socrates; it is because you say the divine monitor (*daimonion*) keeps coming to you. So he has brought the indictment against you for making innovations in religion, and he is going into court to slander you, knowing that slanders on such subjects are readily accepted by the people. (3b)
---
class: f30px
## Sophist?

> SOCRATES: No, for perhaps they think that you are reserved and unwilling to impart your wisdom. But I fear that because of my love of men they think that I not only pour myself out copiously to anyone and everyone without payment, but that I would even pay something myself, if anyone would listen to me. Now if, as I was saying just now, they were to laugh at me, as you say they do at you, it would not be at all unpleasant to pass the time in the court with jests and laughter; but if they are in earnest, then only soothsayers like you can tell how this will end. (3d-e)

class: f31px
## The Right

> SOCRATES: Your father, my dear man?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Certainly.
> 
> SOCRATES: But what is the charge, and what is the suit about?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Murder, Socrates.
> 
> SOCRATES: Heracles! Surely, Euthyphro, most people do not know where the right lies; for I fancy it is not everyone who can rightly do what you are doing, but only one who is already very far advanced in wisdom. (4a)
---
class: f32px
## Definition of "Right"

> EUTHYPHRO: It is ridiculous, Socrates, that you think it matters whether the man who was killed was a stranger or a relative, and do not see that the only thing to consider is whether the action of the slayer was justified or not, and that if it was justified one ought to let him alone, and if not, one ought to proceed against him, even if he share one’s hearth and eat at one’s table. For the pollution is the same if you associate knowingly with such a man and do not purify yourself and him by proceeding against him. (4b-c)

## Questions of the Wise

> SOCRATES: Now in the name of Zeus, tell me what you just now asserted that you knew so well. What do you say is the nature of piety and impiety, both in relation to murder and to other things? Is not holiness always the same with itself in every action, and, on the other hand, is not unholiness the opposite of all holiness, always the same with itself and whatever is to be unholy possessing some one characteristic quality?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Certainly, Socrates.
> 
> SOCRATES: Tell me then, what do you say holiness is, and what unholiness?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Well then, I say that holiness is doing what I am doing now, prosecuting the wrongdoer who commits murder or steals from the temples or does any such thing, whether he be your father or your mother or anyone else, and not prosecuting him is unholy. (5d-e)
---
class: f24px, no-margin
## Tell Me More

> SOCRATES: I dare say. But you can tell me those things at your leisure some other time. At present try to tell more clearly what I asked you just now. For, my friend, you did not give me sufficient information before, when I asked what holiness was, but you told me that this was holy which you are now doing, prosecuting your father for murder.
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Well, what I said was true, Socrates.
> 
> SOCRATES: Perhaps. But, Euthyphro, you say that many other things are holy, do you not?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Why, so they are.
> 
> SOCRATES: Now call to mind that this is not what I asked you, to tell me one or two of the many holy acts, but to tell the essential aspect, by which all holy acts are holy; for you said that all unholy acts were unholy and all holy ones holy by one aspect. (6c-e)
---
class: f26px
## *Dissoi Logoi*

> SOCRATES: But you say that the same things are considered right by some of them and wrong by others; and it is because they disagree about these things that they quarrel and wage war with each other. Is not this what you said?
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: It is.
> 
> SOCRATES: Then, as it seems, the same things are hated and loved by the gods, and the same things would be dear and hateful to the gods. 
>
> EUTHYPHRO: So it seems.
> 
> SOCRATES: And then the same things would be both holy and unholy, Euthyphro, according to this statement. (7e-8a)
---
class: f32px
## The Problem

> SOCRATES: Then you did not answer my question, nay friend. For I did not ask you what is at once holy and unholy; but, judging from your reply, what is dear to the gods is also hateful to the gods. And so, Euthyphro, it would not be surprising if, in punishing your father as you are doing, you were performing an act that is pleasing to Zeus, but hateful to Cronus and Uranus, and pleasing to Hephaestus, but hateful to Hera, and so forth in respect to the other gods, if any disagree with any other about it. (8a-b)
---
class: no-margin, f20px
## The Ending

> SOCRATES: Then we must begin again at the beginning and ask what holiness is. Since I shall not willingly give up until I learn. And do not scorn me, but by all means apply your mind now to the utmost and tell me the truth; for you know, if any one does, and like Proteus, you must be held until you speak. For if you had not clear knowledge of holiness and unholiness, you would surely not have undertaken to prosecute your aged father for murder for the sake of a servant. You would have been afraid to risk the anger of the gods, in case your conduct should be wrong, and would have been ashamed in the sight of men. But now I am sure you think you know what is holy and what is not. So tell me, most excellent Euthyphro, and do not conceal your thought.
> 
> EUTHYPHRO: Some other time, Socrates. Now I am in a hurry and it is time for me to go.
> 
> SOCRATES: Oh my friend, what are you doing? You go away and leave me cast down from the high hope I had that I should learn from you what is holy, and what is not, and should get rid of Meletus’s indictment by showing him that I have been made wise by Euthyphro about divine matters and am no longer through ignorance acting carelessly and making innovations in respect to them, and that I shall live a better life henceforth.
