# Desiderius Erasmus, From *De Copia*

## Discussion Question (Emily)

> It does not worry me that certain writers have been blamed for excessive or  misjudged fullness of diction. Quintilian censures Stesichorus for overabundant and  extravagant expression, while at the same time admitting that it is a fault that  cannot be absolutely avoided. Aeschylus is assailed in Old Comedy for saying the  same thing twice: (back Iâ€™ve come and here I am). There are times when Seneca can  hardly put up with Virgil chanting the same sentiment two or three times. So as not  tot waste time going through a long catalogue, there have even been people who  decried Marcus Tullius himself as favouring the florid Asian style and indulging in  excessive verbosity.

What is more effective, simple & short to the point VS detailed & extravagant  statements/explanations? Is one inherently better than the other, regardless of the  possibility of redundancy or simplicity? Situation? Audience?

## Purpose For Writing

> The speech of man is a magnificent and impressive thing when it surges along like a golden river, with thoughts and words pouring out in rich abundance. Yet the pursuit of speech like this involves considerable risk â€¦ They pile up a meaningless heap of words and expressions without any discrimination, and thus obscure the subject they are talking about, as well as belaboring the ears of their unfortunate audience. In fact, quite a few persons of no real education or understanding have, heaven help us, undertaken to give instruction in this very subject, and these, wile professing mastery of *copia*, have merely revealed their own total lack of it.
>
> Such considerations have induced me to put forward some ideas on *copia*, the abundant style, myself, treating its two aspects of content and expression, and giving some examples and patterns.  (I.i)

## The Place of Style

> One of my reasons for is that I have undertaken this task solely out of a desire to be helpful, so I shall be quite content for another to reap the glory, so long as I am ultimately responsible for some benefit reaching the students. Also I am committed to more serious studies which prevent me from expending a great deal of labor on topics which, in spite of their considerable contribution to serious subjects, themselves seem unimportant. (I.i)

## Historical Grounding
> Now in case anyone should feel inclined to despise it as some newfangled discovery recently brought into the world within the four walls of my own study, I would have him know that this whole idea of being able to express one's meaning in a variety of ways is in a number of places touched on by that learned and thorough writer Quintilian; further, that a number of famous sophists blazed a trail, showing how to compress and abridge what was being said, and this they could not have done without at the same time demonstrating how to expand it. If their books were extant, or if Quintilian had been prepared to set out his recommendations in full, there would not have been such need of these modest injunctions of mine. (I.ii)

## Expand + Contract
> The purpose of these instructions is to enable you so to include the essentials in the fewest possible words that nothing is lacking, or so to enlarge and enrich your expression of it that even so nothing is redundant. (I.vi)

> To take compression of language first, who will speak more succinctly than the man who can readily and without hesitation pick out from a huge army of words, from the whole range of figures of speech, the feature that contributes most effectively to brevity? And as for compression of content, who will show the greatest mastery in setting out his subject in the fewest possible words if not the man who has carefully worked out what are the salient points of his case, the pillars so to speak on which it rests, distinguishing them from the subsidiary points and things brought in merely for embellishment? No one in fact will see more swiftly and surely what can be omitted without disadvantage than the man who can see where and how to make additions. (I.v)

## Verbal Riches
> If in these circumstances we find ourselves destitute of verbal riches and hesitate, or keep singing out the same old phrase like a cuckoo, and are unable to clothe our thought in other colors or other forms, we shall look ridiculous when we show ourselves to be tongue-tied. (I.viii)

## Natural Variety
> Nature above all delights in variety; in all this huge concourse of things, she has left nothing anywhere unpainted by her wonderful technique of variety. (I.viii)

## Roots in Tradition

> Now in case anyone should feel inclined to despise it as some newfangled discovery recently brought into the world within the four walls of my own study, I would have him know that this whole idea of being able to express one's meaning in a variety of ways is in a number of places touched on by that learned and thorough writer Quintilian, further, that a number of famous sophists blazed a trail, showing how to compress and abridge what was being said, and this they could not have done without at the same time demonstrating how to expand it. (I.ii)

## Humor

> If we are afraid that the antiquity or novelty of our word may offend the ears of our audience, the best thing will be to take Quintilian's advice and remember to forestall criticism by commenting on the word ourselves. Here are some sample ways of doing this: Cato, a glutton for books ...
>
>*Vulgar words*
>
> Vulgar words are those which will strike the hearer as rather too common for the dignity of the context, like calling one's familiar friend one's "old hearty," or an avid reader "a glutton for literature" (I.xi)

## "Practical" Demonstration

Let us, for example, take this sentence: "Your letter pleased me mightily"

> *your*: There is no synonym for "your," but a periphrasis is possible: Your excellency's, your highness's, your majesty's. If we insert a proper name such as "Faustus" and say "Faustus's letter," we employ two forms of heterosis, the substitution of a noun for a pronoun and of a third person for a second. If we say "Faustine letters," using a derivative adjective instead of the genitive of the noun, that is yet another form of heterosis.
>
> *letter*: epistle, letter, note (synonym); epistolet, letterette, notelet (heterosis); pages, lines (synecdoche); what you wrote to me (periphrasis).
>
> *pleased*: delighted, refreshed, exhilarated (synonyms, though "exhilarated" is better considered a metaphor); brought pleasure, were a pleasure, were delightful (these and similar expressions illustrate periphrasis); bathed in delight, were honey-sweet, and so on (transferred or metaphorical expressions); were not unwelcome, not unpleasing (these result from the interchange of opposites). (I.xxxiii)

## Placing Words

> There are many things for which the poets use one set of words, orators another. There are also words peculiar to different ages and centuries, and even the same authors often express the same thing by different means. So the first thing is to extract the best words one can from every type of writer, and whatever they are like, add them to the collection. No word is to be rejected, provided it occurs in an author who is at all respectable, for there is no word which would not be best one in some place or other. So however vulgar, unusual, poetic, archaic, novel, obsolete, harsh, barbarous, or foreign it may be, lay it up in its proper niche with its fellows, so that you may summon it if ever a use for it arises. (I.xi)
