## Discussion Leader (Becky)

> …Sometimes it may happen that the prince by bad counsel or from some other cause, will try to oppress his people with some expense. The subjects will realize that their lady is full of pity, goodness, and charity, and will come to her and very humbly beseech her to represent them to the prince… (pg. 546)  
> …She will be accompanied by wise and upright gentlemen who will counsel her. She will reply wisely and suitably with the help of the good advice of those men…(pg. 546)  
> …She will urge the people, her husband, and his council to consider this matter carefully…(pg. 547)  
> …The lady will not hesitate for a moment, but will speak or have someone else speak…(pg.547)
 
A princess is a force for good in her kingdom; she is supposed to keep the peace, plead for her subjects, and petition to the ruling men to reconsider their decisions. As good as all these things are however, it seems rather than indicating that women need to be wise and skilled in speaking, the text recommends that women be "full of pity, goodness, and charity" in order to make people trust them.  The ideal princess depends on both Ethos and the advice of counselors to make her point. Does this concept take away from the importance of content and style by replacing it with Ethos? Why or why not?

> And so this lady will be, by pure, mild, and holy charity, an advocate and mediator between the prince her husband (or her child if she is a widow) and her people, or all people whom she may be able to help by doing good, depending on the situation. Sometimes it may happen that the prince, by bad counsel or from some other cause, will try to oppress his people with some expense. The subjects will realize that their lady is full of pity, goodness, and charity, and will come to her and very humbly beseech her to represent them to the prince, for they are very poor and would not be able to meet such an expense without very great hardship or without being ruined. If they have offended the prince, whether because of someone’s gossip of flattery or because they deserve his displeasure, they will come humbly to her to beg her to make peace for them…She will be accompanied by wise and upright gentlemen who will counsel her. She will reply wisely and suitably with the help of the good advice of those men; she will excuse her husband and speak well of him.

## Discussion Leader (Megan)
As a defensive response to unwarranted attacks, Christine de Pizan’s allegory is held to be first feminist text written in Western Europe. In this passage, de Pizan clearly outlines the ideal traits all women of the court should possess if to be considered virtues and powerful. Being that this is written in the 15th century, do you believe these ideals were possible for women to portray and imitate? Secondly, when comparing 15 th century feminism to present day, have any of these ideal traits remained constant in the movement, or are they been replaced by more modern characteristics?

## Wise Negotiator

> And so this lady will be, by pure, mild and holy charity, an advocate and mediator between the prince her husband (or her child if she is a widow) and her people, or all people whom she may be able to help by doing good, depending on the situation. Sometimes it may happen that the prince, by bad counsel or from some other cause, will try to oppress his people with some expense. The subjects will realize that their lady is full of pity, goodness and charity, and will come to her and very humbly beseech her to represent them to the prince, for they are very poor and would not be able to meet such an expense without very great hardship or without being ruined. (546)

## Mediator For Subjects

> In this way the noble lady will reply so wisely to the ambassadors of the people or of her subjects that when they go away from her they will be satisfied to the extent that if they previously had some grievance, rebellion or quarrel in mind, they will all be pacified. The good lady will not make them waste their time in vain hope, bu without long delay she will scrupulously keep her word about what she has promised them; she will speak to her husband well and wisely, call ing in other wise persons if necessary, and will very humbly petition him on behalf of the people. (546)
---
class: f35px
## Work for Peace

> Since the good lady will bear these things in mind and feel pity for the destruction of the people, she will wish to work to make peace. She will urge the people, her husband, and his council to consider this matter carefully before undertaking it, in view of the evil which could result from it. Any prince ought to avoid as far as he can the spilling of blood, especially that of his own subjects. (547)
---
class: f35px
## Strategic Essentialism

> Ladies in particular ought to attend to this business, for men are by nature core courageous and more hot-headed, and the great desire they have to avenge themselves prevents their considering either the perils or the evils that can result from war. But women are by nature more timid and also of a sweeter disposition and for this reason, if they are wise and if they wish to, they can be the best means of pacifying men. (547)
---
class: f27px
## Division

> We come now to the second point, which is the other vice that the lady, maiden, and woman of the court and all others ought to guard against, that is, the sin of slander, because there is no excuse for slander. To elucidate our case better, we will touch on three causes from which slander commonly comes and arises and which are all common at court, individually and sometimes all three together.
>
>The first of the causes is hatred, the second opinion, and the third is sheer envy. These three causes are indeed wicked, but the one that comes from envy is the least excusable. All three are to be avoided for in no circumstances is slander praiseworthy, but rather it is a most forbidden mortal sin. (548)
---
class: f23px
## Hatred & Discourse

> We do not usually hate someone unless the other person has injured us or, rightly or wrongly, we think he has. Then the injured party is most inclined by hatred and spite to slander the one who she thinks has injured her. This is a frequent occurrence at court. A lady or other woman of the court will find out that some people or a certain person is harming her and getting her in bad with her mistress, or the master, or her friends. This other person or faction may be trying to have her dismissed, and perhaps they will succeed in their intention. This lady or maiden stands to lose her service, her livelihood, and her position because of it, and perhaps her honor as well because of the things that she is accused of perhaps without foundation. Even supposing that there was a good reason for these allegations, she will hate the person who has made them. She will doubtless slander her, in private and in public, if the person is not so great that she dares not speak of her, otherwise it will be very difficult to complain about it in the slightest.  (548)
---
class: f32px
## Ethos

> The third reason is that those who hear some one who bears a grudge slandering her adversaries or enemies will not believe her. They will say that she is saying it out of hatred and it ought not to be believed. The fourth reason is that the person who has already harmed her or is able to harm her will be that much more indignant when she hears that she is slandering her. She will be to increase the injury and do still worse to her. It would be preferable to receive one injury rather than two. (549)
---
class: f25px
## Truth

> The second cause that gives rise to slander is a wrong impression formed in something like the following manner: one person will have the idea that another is bad or at fault in something or in everything, or that she does not always behave well in all circumstances, and for this reason and without knowing the truth of the matter (which is perhaps quite otherwise than she thought), on the flimsiest grounds she will misjudge and slander her widely and blatantly with hardly a second thought. Such situations commonly arise everywhere. Doubtless because of opinion and because of not knowing all the facts of the case, those slander most who already have the tendency to slander anyway. There is commonly not a court of a prince and princess without such slanderers, who for such a cause, that is, opinion only, do not spare a soul, not even master or mistress. (549)
---
class: f25px
## Role of Servants

> But this misjudging is the least of their offenses, for she is their lady, who gives them food and shelter and good wages from her coffers. Although these people may well curtsy respectfully to her, with one knee touching the ground, and make deep bows and flatter her a great deal, yet they will not keep quiet about gossip, but they will tell each other their impressions, and they will whisper scandal to each other. In a word, they will be just like the bad sheep that is mangy and infects the others. But all of them, you notice, take care that their mistress does not get wind of it. They will be content as long as it is concealed from her alone. They will even agree with and support her, saying that it would be a good idea to do thus and so. They will laugh at her and talk about her behind her back, and they will embroider the story with invented details. (549)
---
class: f32px
## How To Be Good

> Now here is what the good lady or maiden or other persons of the court will do who wishes to enjoy a good conscience: she will love the wellbeing and honor of her mistress, and when she sees her honor decline and her mistress in peril of go to her mistress's confessor and not to anyone else. She will tell him secretly and in confession, what is being said about her, and the peril in which she is putting herself and the evil that could come to her from it. She will beg him for the love of God to teach her and not accuse her. (550)
---
class: f36px
## Ethos (again)

> Furthermore, the women of the court ought likewise never to rebuke or defame one another, as much because of the sin and other reasons already mentioned, as for the fact that whoever would slyly defame another is herself defamed. For assuredly the person who knows that someone is defaming her will also slander that person, and she may even make up stories. (550)
---
class: f31px
## Manage Discourse

> In this respect the court of a princess ought to be like a well-regulated abbey where the monks have an oath that they will say nothing to outsiders about their secrets or anything that may happen among them. In just the same way ladies and women of the court ought to love and support each other like sisters. They ought not to quarrel with one another in the ladies' apartments, nor betray each other behind their backs like fishwives, for such things are extremely unbecoming at the court of a princess, and they ought not to be allowed. (550-551)
