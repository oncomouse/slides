## "Good enough"

> POLUS: By Zeus, Chaerephon! Try me, if you like! I think Gorgias is quite worn out. He's only just now finished a long discourse.
>
> CHAEREPHON: Really, Polus? Do you think you'd give more admirable answers than Gorgias?
>
> POLUS: What does it matter, as long as they're good enough for you? (448b)
---
class: f25px
## *Dissoi Logoi*

> CHAEREPHON: Now then, since he's an expert in a craft, what is it, and what would be the correct thing to call him?
>
> POLUS: Many among men are the crafts devised by experience, Chaerephon, the results of experience. Yes, it is experience that causes our times to march along the way of craft, whereas inexperience causes it to march along the way of chance. Of these various crafts various men partake in various ways, the best men partaking of the best of them. Our Gorgias is indeed in this group; he partakes of the most admirable of the crafts.
>
> SOCRATES: Polus certainly appears to have prepared himself admirably for giving speeches, Gorgias. But he's not doing what he promised Chaerephon. (448c-d)
---
class: f27px
## Different Languages

> GORGIAS: Why don't you question him then, if you like?
>
> SOCRATES: No, I won't, not as long as you yourself may want to answer. I'd much rather ask you. It's clear to me, especially from what he said, that Polus has devoted himself more to what is called oratory then to discussing.
>
> POLUS: Why do you say that, Socrates?
>
> SOCRATES: Because, Polus, when Chaerephon ask you what craft Gorgias is knowledgeable in, you sing its praises as though someone were discrediting it. But you haven't answered what it is. (448d-e)
---
class: f21px, no-margin
## Disciplines Are Their Content?

> SOCRATES: Come on, then. Please complete your answers in the terms of my question. Since oratory is one of those crafts which mostly uses speech, and since there are also others of that source, try to say *what* it is that oratory, which exercise its influence through speeches, is about. Imagine someone asking me about any of the crafts I mentioned just now, "Socrates, what is the craft of arithmetic?" I tell him, just as you told me, that it's one of those that exercise their influence by means of speech.  And if you continued, "what are they crafts about?" I'd say that they're about even and odd, however many of each there might be. If he did asked, "what is the craft you call computation?" I'd say that this one, too, is one of those that exercise their influence entirely by speech. And if he in continued, "what is it about?" I'd answer in the style of those who drop motions in the Assembly that in other respects competition is like arithmetic – for it's about the same thing, even and odd – yet it differs from arithmetic insofar as computation examines the quantity of even and odd, both in relation to themselves in relation to each other. And if someone asks about astronomy and I replied that it, too, exercise its influence by means of speech, then if he asked, "what are the speeches of astronomy about, Socrates?" I'd say there about the motions of the stars, the sun and the moon, and their relative velocities. (451b-c)

class: f36px
## What is the Content of Rhetoric?


> SOCRATES: Tell us then: What are the crafts about? Of the things there are, which is the one that these speeches used by oratory are concerned with?
> 
> GORGIAS: The greatest of human concerns, Socrates, and the best.
> 
> SOCRATES: But that statement, too, is debatable, Gorgias. (451d)
---
class: f26px
## What is Rhetoric About?

>SOCRATES: Listen then, Gorgias. You should know that I'm convinced I'm one of those people who in a discussion with someone else really want to have knowledge of the subject the discussions about. And I consider you one of them, too.
>
>GORGIAS: Well, what's the point, Socrates?
>
>SOCRATES: Let me tell you now. You can know for sure that I don't know what this persuasion derived from oratory that you're talking about is, or what subjects it's persuasion about. Even though I do have my suspicions about which persuasion I think you mean, and what it's about, I'll still ask you just the same what you say is persuasion produced by oratory is, and what it's about. (453b)
---
class: f23px
## Doing vs Learning

> SOCRATES: Does a person who teaches some subject or other persuade people about what he's teaching, or not?
> 
> GORGIAS: He certainly does, Socrates. He persuades most of all.
> 
> SOCRATES: Let's talk once more about the same crafts we were talking about just now. Doesn't arithmetic or the arithmetician teachers everything that pertains to numbers?
> 
> GORGIAS: Yes, he does.
> 
> SOCRATES: And he also persuades?
> 
> GORGIAS: Yes.
> 
> SOCRATES: So arithmetic is also a producer of persuasion. (453d-e)
---
class: f25px
## Method

> GORGIAS: The persuasion I mean, Socrates, is the kind that takes place in law courts and in those other large gatherings, as I was saying a moment ago. And it's concerned with those matters that are just and unjust.
> 
> SOCRATES: Yes, Gorgias, I suspected that this was the persuasion you meant, and that these are the matters it's persuasion about. But so you won't be surprised if in a moment I ask you again another question like this, about what seems to be clear, and yet I go on with my questioning – as I say, I'm asking questions so that we can conduct an orderly discussion. It's not you I'm after; it's to prevent our getting in the habit of second-guessing and snatching each other statements away ahead of time. It's to allow you to work out your assumption any way you want to. (454b-c)

## Gorgia's Defense

> GORGIAS: One should, however, use oratory like any other competitive skill, Socrates. In other cases, two, one ought not to use a competitive skill against any and everybody, just because he has learned boxing, or boxing and wrestling combined, or fighting armor, so as to make himself be superior to his friends as well as to his enemies. That's no reason to strike, stab, or kill one's own friends! Imagine someone who after attending wrestling school, getting his body into good shape and becoming a boxer, went on to strike his father and mother or any other family member or friend. By Zeus, that's no reason to hate physical trainers and people who teach fighting in armor, and exile them from their cities! For while these people imparted their skills to be used justly against enemies and wrongdoers, and in defense, not aggression, their pupils perverted their strength and skill and misuse them. So it's not their teachers who are wicked, nor is this a reason why the craft should be a cause of wickedness; the ones who miss use it are supposedly the wicked ones. (456d-457a)
---
class: f27px
## Polus Arrives (Awkwardly)

> POLUS: Really, Socrates? Is what you're now saying about oratory what you actually think of it? Or do you really think, just because Gorgias was too ashamed not to concede your further claim that the orator also knows what's just, what's admirable, and what's good, and that if you came to him without already having this knowledge to begin with, he said that he would teach him himself, and then from this admission maybe some inconsistency crept into his statements – just the thing that gives you delight, you're the one who leads him on to face such questions – who do you think would deny that he himself knows what's just and would teach others? To lead your arguments to such an outcome is a sign of great rudeness. (461b-c)

## Knack

> POLUS: Tell me, Socrates, since you think Gorgias is confused about oratory, what do you say it is?
> 
> SOCRATES: Are you asking me what craft I say it is?
> 
> POLUS: Yes, I am.
> 
> SOCRATES: To tell you the truth, Polus, I don’t think it’s a craft at all.
> 
> POLUS: Well then, what do you think oratory is?
> 
> SOCRATES: In the treatise that I read recently, it’s the thing that you say has produced craft.
> 
> POLUS: What do you mean?
> 
> SOCRATES: I mean a knack.
> 
> POLUS: So you think oratory’s a knack?
> 
> SOCRATES: Yes, I do, unless you say it’s something else.
> 
> POLUS: A knack for what?
> 
> SOCRATES: For producing a certain gratification and pleasure. (462b-c)

---
class: no-margin, two-column, f22px
## Pastry Baking?

> SOCRATES: Ask me now what craft I think pastry baking is.
> 
> POLUS: All right, I will. What craft is pastry baking?
> 
> SOCRATES: It isn’t one at all, Polus. Now say, “What is it then?”
> 
> POLUS: All right.
> 
> SOCRATES: It’s a knack. Say, “A knack for what?”
> 
> POLUS: All right.
> 
> SOCRATES: For producing gratification and pleasure, Polus.
> 
> POLUS: So oratory is the same thing as pastry baking?
> 
> SOCRATES: Oh no, not at all, although it is a part of the same practice.
> 
> POLUS: What practice do you mean?
> 
> SOCRATES: … I call it flattery, basically … This part *seems* to be acraft, but in my account of it it isn't a craft but a knack and a routine. I call oratory [and pastry-baking] a part of this, too, along with cosmetics and sophistry. (462d-463b)

---
class: f28px
## Doing / Suffering Injustice

> SOCRATES: It's because doing what's unjust is actually the greatest of evils.
> 
> POLUS: Really? Is *that* the greatest? Isn't suffering what's unjust a greater one?
> 
> SOCRATES: No, not in the least.
> 
> POLUS: So you'd want to suffer what's unjust rather than do it?
> 
> SOCRATES: I certainly wouldn't want either, but if it had to be one or the other, I would choose suffering over doing what's unjust. (469b-c)
---
class: f30px
## Deserved / Is

> SOCRATES: Now wasn't this the point to dispute between us, my friend? You considered Archelaus happy, a man who committed the greatest crimes without paying what was due, whereas I took the opposite view, that whoever avoids paying his due for his wrongdoing, whether he's Archelaus or any other man, deserves to be miserable beyond all other men, and that one who does what's unjust is always more miserable than the one who suffers it, and the one who avoids paying what's due always more miserable than the one who does pay it. Weren't these the things I said? (479d-e)

---
class: f22px, no-margin
## Oratory as a Means of Self Correction

> SOCRATES: So, if oratory is used to defend injustice, Polus, one's own or that of one's relatives, companions, or children, or that of one's country when it acts unjustly, it is of no use to us at all, unless one takes it to be useful for the opposite purpose: that he should accuse himself first and foremost, and then too his family and anyone else dear to him who happens to behave unjustly at any time; and that he should not keep his wrongdoing hidden but bring it out into the open, so that he may pay his due and get well; and compel himself and the others not to play the coward, but to grit his teeth and present himself with grace and courage as to a doctor for cauterization and surgery, pursuing what's good and admirable without taking any account of the pain. And if his unjust behavior merits flogging, he should present himself to be whipped; if it merits imprisonment, to be imprisoned; if a fine, to pay it; if exile, to be exiled; and if execution, to be executed. He should be his own chief accuser, and the accuser of other members of his family, and use his oratory for the purpose of getting rid of the greatest evil, injustice, as the unjust acts are being exposed.  (480c-d)
---
class: f25px
## Callicles's Rhetoric of Self-Empowerment

> No, no man would put up with suffering what's unjust; only a slave would do so, one who is better dead than alive, who when he's treated unjustly and abused can't protect himself or anyone else he cares about. I believe that the people who institute our laws are the weak and the many. They do this, and they assign praise and blame with themselves and their own advantage in mind. They're afraid of the more powerful among men, the ones who are capable of having a greater share, and so they say that getting more than one's share is "shameful" and "unjust," and that doing what's unjust is trying to get more than one's share. They do this so that those people won't get a greater share than they. I think they like getting an equal share, since they are inferior. (483b-c)
---
class: f26px, no-margin
## Ruling Themselves

> SOCRATES: But what of themselves, my friend?
>
> CALLICLES: What of *what*?
>
> SOCRATES: Ruling or being ruled?
>
> CALLICLES: What do you mean?
>
> SOCRATES: I mean each individual ruling himself. Or is there no need at all to rule himself, but only to rule others?
>
> CALLICLES: What do you mean, rule himself?
>
> SOCRATES: Nothing very subtle. Just what the many mean: being self-controlled and master of oneself, ruling the pleasures and the appetites within oneself. (491d-e)
---
class: f34px
## Knack for Tradition

> SOCRATES: The other, the one concerned with pleasure, to which the whole of its service is entirely devoted, proceeds toward its object quite inexpertly, without having at all considered either the nature of pleasure or its cause. It does so completely irrationally, with virtually no discrimination. Through routine and knack it merely preserves the memory of what customarily happens, and that's how it also supplies its pleasures. (501a-b)
---
class: f34px
## Justice and the Soul

> SOCRATES: So this is what that skilled and good orator will look to when he applies as all of his actions, and any gift he makes or any confiscation he carries out. He will always give his attention to how justice may come to exist in the souls of his fellow citizens and injustice be gotten rid of, how self-control may come to exist there and lack of discipline be gotten rid of, and how the rest of excellence may come into being there and evil may depart. (505d-e)
---
class: f30px
## Talking To Himself

> SOCRATES: Listen, then, as I pick up the discussion from the beginning. Is the pleasant the same as the good?—It isn't as Callicles and I have agreed.—Is the pleasant to be done for the sake of the good, or the good for the sake of the pleasant?—The pleasant for the sake of the good.—And *pleasant* is that by which, when it's come to be present in us, we feel pleasure, and good that by which, when it's present in us, we feel pleasure, and good that by which, when some excellence has come to be present in us?—Yes, I do think that's necessarily so, Callicles?... (506c-d)
---
class: f32px
## Live Beyond Yourself

> SOCRATES: But, my blessed man, please see whether what's noble and what's good isn't something other than preserving and being preserved. Perhaps one who is truly a man should stop thinking about how long he will live. He should not be attached to life but should commit these concerns to the god and believe the women who say that not one single person can escape fate. He should thereupon give consideration to how he might live the part of his life still before him as well as possible. (512d-e)

## The Orator Takes On the Character of the City

## The Orator Takes On the Character of the City

> SOCRATES: For each group of people take delight in speeches that are given in its own character, and resents those given in an alien manner. (513b)

> SOCRATES: You sing the praises of those who threw parties for these people, and who feasted them lavishly with what they had an appetite for. And they say that *they* have made the city great! But that the city is swollen and festering, thanks to those early leaders, that they don't notice. For they filled the city with harbors and dockyards, walls, and tribute payments and such trash as that, but did so without justice and self-control. So, when that fit of sickness comes on, they'll blame their advisers of the moment and sing the praises of Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles … if you're not careful, they'll lay their hands on you … when they lose not only what they gained but what they had originally as well (518e-519a)

## The Ending

> SOCRATES: So, listen to me and follow me to where I am, and when you've come here you'll be happy both during life and at its end, as the account indicates. Let someone despise you as a fool and throw dirt on you, if he likes. And, yes, by Zeus, confidently let him deal you that demeaning blow. Nothing terrible will happen to you if you really are an admirable and good man, one who practices excellence. And then, after we've practiced it together, then at last, if we think we should, we'll turn to politics, or then we'll deliberate about whatever subject we please, when we're better at deliberating than we are now. For it's a shameful thing for us, being in the condition we appear to be in at present—when we never think the same about the same subjects, the most important ones at that—to sound off as though we're somebodies. That's how far behind in education we've fallen. (527c-e)
