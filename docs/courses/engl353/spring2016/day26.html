    # John Locke <br> *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*
    ---
    ## Discussion Leader (Blake)
    
    > It is an established opinion amongst some men, that there are in the understanding certain innate principles; some primary notions, ϰοιναὶ ἔννοιαι, characters, as it were, stamped upon the mind of man, which the soul receives in its very first being; and brings into the world with it. It would be sufficient to convince unprejudiced readers of the falseness of this supposition, if I should only shew (as I hope I shall in the following parts of this discourse) how men, barely by the use of their natural faculties, may attain to all the knowledge they have, without the help of any innate impressions; and may arrive at certainty, without any such original notions or principles.
    
    John Locke is credited with the creation of British Empiricism. A psychological principle dealing with how humans learn. According to this theory humans are born as blank slates, or having no inborn knowledge of anything. All knowledge is gleaned through a persons life either through the five senses or later reflection on those things. According to Locke, humans start of with simple ideas and add other simple ideas on those to create larger more complex ideas. Using what we now know about learning, what did Locke get right about learning and in what ways did he challenge preconceived notions about how human beings operate.

    ## Discussion Leader (Aaron)
    
    > He that hath names without ideas, wants meaning in his words, and speaks only empty sounds. He that hath complex ideas without names for them, wants liberty and dispatch in his expressions and is necessitated to use periphrases. He that uses his words loosely and unsteadily will either be not minded, or not understood. He that applies his names to ideas different from their common use, wants propriety to ideas in his language and speaks gibberish. And he that hath the ideas of substances disagreeing with the real existence of things so far wants the materials of true knowledge in his understanding, and hath instead thereof chimeras. (31)
    
    Is communication lost when there is a misunderstanding of certain word meanings between speaker and listener? Or do we have the ability as human being to put together what a person means? Does this lack of specific understanding or agreement between the two mean we are never communicating exactly what we mean and that all that really gets across is a piece of the message?

    ## Language as Problem
    
    > From what has been said in the foregoing chapters, it is easy to perceive what imperfection there is in language, and how the very nature of words makes it almost unavoidable for many of them to be thoughts. doubtful and uncertain in their significations. To examine the perfection or imperfection of words, it is necessary first to consider their use and end: for as they are more or less fitted to attain that, so they are more or less perfect. We have, in the former part of this discourse, often upon occasion mentioned a double use of words.
    >
    >First, one for the recording of our own thoughts.
    >
    >Secondly, the other for the communicating of our thoughts to others.
    ---
    ## Modern Understanding of Language
    
    > As to the first of these, *for the recording our own thoughts for the help of our own memories*, whereby, as it were, we talk to ourselves, any words will serve the turn. For since sounds are voluntary and indifferent signs of any ideas, a man may use what words he pleases, to signify his own ideas to himself: and there will be no imperfection in them, if he constantly use the same sign for the same idea: for then he cannot fail of having his meaning understood, wherein consists the right use and perfection of language.

    ## Problem of Meaning: Miscommunication
    
    > The chief end of language in communication being to be understood, words serve not well for that end, neither in civil nor philosophical discourse, when any word docs not excite in the hearer the same idea  which it stands for in the mind of the speaker.
    ---
    ## Meaning Problems
    
    > Words have naturally no signification, the idea which each stands for must be learned and retained, by those who would exchange thoughts, and hold intelligible discourse with others, in any language. But this is the hardest to be done where,
    >
    > First, The ideas they stand for are very complex, and made up of a great number of ideas put together.
    >
    > Secondly, Where the ideas they stand for have no certain connection in nature; and so no settled standard anywhere in nature existing, to rectify and adjust them by.
    >
    > Thirdly, When the signification of the word is referred to a standard, which standard is not easy to be known.
    >
    > Fourthly, Where the signification of the word and the real essence of the thing are not exactly the same.
    ---
    ## Propriety
    
    > It is true, common use, that is the rule of propriety, may be supposed here to afford some aid, to settle the signification of language; and it cannot be denied, but that in some measure it does. Common use regulates the meaning of words pretty well for common conversation; but nobody having an authority to establish the precise signification of words, nor determined to what ideas any one shall annex them, common use is not sufficient to adjust them t o philosophical discourses; there being scarce any name of any very complex idea (to say nothing of others) which in common use has not a great latitude, and which keeping within the bounds of propriety, may not be made the sign of far different ideas. Besides, the rule and measure of propriety itself being no where established, it is often matter of dispute whether this or that way of using a word be propriety of speech or no.

    ## Homophones
    
    > Though the names *glory* and *gratitude* be the same in every man's mouth through a whole country, yet the complex collective idea, which every one thinks on, or intends by that name, is apparently very different in men using the same language.
    ---
    ## Childhood
    
    > The way also wherein the names of mixed modes are ordinarily learned, does not a little contribute to the doubtfulness of their signification. For if we will observe how children learn languages, we shall find that to make them understand what the names of simple ideas, or substances, stand for, people ordinarily show them the thing, whereof they would have them have the idea; and then repeat to them the name that stands for it, as white, sweet, milk, sugar, cat, dog. But as for mixed modes, especially the most material of them, moral words, the sounds are usually learned first; and then to know what complex ideas they stand for, they are either beholden to the explication of others, or (which happens for the most part) are left to their own observation and industry;

    ## Learning vs Intuition
    
    > These ideas of men’s making are, by men still having the same power, multiplied in infinitum. Many a man who was pretty well satisfied of the meaning of a text of scripture, or clause in the code, at first reading, has by consulting commentators quite lost the sense of it, and by these elucidations given rise or increase to his doubts, and drawn obscurity upon the place.
    ---
    ## Obscurity
    
    > What obscurity this has unavoidably brought upon the writings of men, who have lived in remote ages and different countries, it will be needless to take notice; since the numerous volumes of learned men, employing their thoughts that way, are proof‘s more than enough to show what attention, study, sagacity, and reasoning are required, to find out the true meaning of ancient authors. But there being no writings we have any great concernment to be very solicitous about the meaning of, but those that contain either truths we are required to believe, or laws we are to obey, and draw inconveniences on us when we mistake or transgress, we may he less anxious about the sense of other authors; who writing but their own opinions, we are under no greater necessity to know them, than they to know ours.

    ## Chemistry
    
    > The simple qualities which make up the complex ideas, being most of them powers, in relation to changes, which they are apt to make in, or receive from other bodies, are almost infinite. He that shall but observe what a great variety of alterations any one of the baser metals is apt to receive from the different application only of fire; and how much a greater number of changes any of them will receive in the hands of a chemist, by the application of other bodies; will not think it strange that I count the properties of any sort of bodies not easy to be collected, and completely known by the ways of inquiry, which our faculties are capable of.
    ---
    ## Ends of Language
    
    > To conclude this consideration of The ends of the imperfection and abuse of language; the language: ends of language in our discourse with others, being chiefly these three: first, to make known one man's thoughts or ideas to another; secondly, to do it with as much ease and quickness as possible; and, thirdly, thereby to convey the knowledge of things: language is either abused or deficient, when it faits of any of these three.
    >
    >First, words fail in the first of these ends, and lay not open one man's ideas to another's view: 1. When men have names in their mouths, without any determinate ideas in their minds, whereof they are the signs; or, When they apply the common received names of any language to ideas, to which the common use of that language does not apply them: or, 3. When they apply them very unsteadily, making them stand now for one, and by and by for another idea.
    ---
    ## Ugh
    
    > Since wit and fancy find easier entertainment in the world, than dry truth and real knowledge, figurative speeches and an abuse of allusion in language will hardly be admitted as an imperfection or abuse of it. I confess in discourses where we seek rather pleasure and delight than information and improvement, such ornaments as are borrowed from them can scarce pass for faults. But yet if we would speak of things as they are, we must allow that all the art of rhetorick, besides order and clearness, all the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence hath invented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment, and so indeed are perfect cheats: and therefore however laudable or allowable oratory may render them in harangues and popular addresses, they are certainly, in all discourses that pretend to inform or instruct, wholly to be avoided;</textarea>
