    > On or about December 1910, human character changed. I am not saying that one went out, as one might into a garden, and there saw that a rose had flowered, or that a hen had laid an egg. The change was not sudden and definite like that. But a change there was, nevertheless; and, since one must be arbitrary, let us date it about the year 1910.

    They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have seen your painted women under the gas lamps  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;luring the farm boys.  
    And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill again.  
    And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faces of women and children I have seen the marks  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of wanton hunger.
    
    And having answered so I turn once more to those who  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer

    Come and show me another city with lifted head singing

    Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on

    .topic[I am the People, the Mob]
    
    I am the people—the mob—the crowd—the mass.  
    Do you know that all the great work of the world is done through me?  
    I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the world's food and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.  
    I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons come from me  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Lincolns. They die. And then I send forth more Napoleons  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Lincolns.  
    I am the seed ground. I am a prairie that will stand for much plowing.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrible storms pass over me. I forget. The best of me is sucked out  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wasted. I forget. Everything but Death comes to me and makes  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me work and give up what I have. And I forget.  
    Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red drops for history  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to remember. Then—I forget.  
    When I, the People, learn to remember, when I, the People, use the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lessons of yesterday and no longer forget who robbed me last year,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who played me for a fool—then there will be no speaker in all the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world say the name: "The People," with any fleck of a sneer in his  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice or any far-off smile of derision.  
    The mob—the crowd—the mass—will arrive then.

    .pull-left[
    
    BY day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a soul.  
    Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poured out again back to the streets, prairies and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valleys.  
    It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out all day that give the building a soul of dreams  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thoughts and memories.  
    (Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way to it?)
      
    Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sewage out.  
    Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell terrors and profits and loves--curses of men  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grappling plans of business and questions of women  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in plots of love.
      
    Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth and hold the building to a turning planet.  
    Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold together the stone walls and floors.
      
    Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;architect voted.  
    Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the press of time running into centuries, play  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the building inside and out and use it.
    
    Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in graves where the wind whistles a wild song  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without words  
    And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.  
    Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer who went to state's prison for shooting another  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man while drunk.  
    (One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end of a straight plunge--he is here--his soul has  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone into the stones of the building.)

    .pull-right[
    
    On the office doors from tier to tier--hundreds of names  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and each name standing for a face written across  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease of life.
      
    Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell nothing from room to room.  
    Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ends of the earth.  
    Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the building just the same as the master-men who  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule the building.
      
    Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empties its men and women who go away and eat  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and come back to work.  
    Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.  
    One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and machine grime of the day.  
    Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money. The sign speaks till midnight.
      
    Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is stacked in them.  
    A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.  
    By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has a soul.
