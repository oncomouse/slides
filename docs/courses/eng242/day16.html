    Droning a drowsy [syncopated](http://www.oed.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/view/Entry/196416?redirectedFrom=syncopation#eid) tune,  
    Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a Negro play.  
    Down on [Lenox Avenue](http://www.longwharf.org/sites/default/files/u3/Cotton%20Club.jpg) the other night  
    By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a lazy sway. . . .  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a lazy sway. . . .  
    To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.  
    With his ebony hands on each ivory key  
    He made that poor piano moan with melody.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Blues!  
    Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool  
    He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Blues!  
    Coming from a black man’s soul.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Blues!  
    In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone  
    I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ain’t got nobody in all this world,  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain’t got nobody but ma self.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put ma troubles on the shelf.”
    
    Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.  
    He played a few chords then he sang some more—  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I got the Weary Blues  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can’t be satisfied.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got the Weary Blues  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can’t be satisfied—  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain’t happy no mo’  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wish that I had died.”  
    And far into the night he crooned that tune.  
    The stars went out and so did the moon.  
    The singer stopped playing and went to bed  
    While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.  
    He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.

    > Six trains each day rumbled past and shook the ground under her cabin. Fords, and horse- and mule-drawn buggies went back and forth along the road. No one ever saw her. Trainmen, and passengers who’d heard about her, threw out papers and food. Threw out little crumpled slips of papers scribbled with prayers, as they passed her eye-shaped piece of sandy ground.

    > Smoke curled up from her chimney. Nobody noticed it. A creepy feeling came over all who saw that thin wraith of smoke and felt the trembling of the ground. Folks began to take her food again. They quit it soon because they had a fear. Becky if dead might be a haint, and if alive - it took some nerve even to mention it…

    > We were just about to pass…Pines shout to Jesus!…the ground trembled as a ghost train rumbled by. The chimney fell into the cabin. Its thud was a hollow report, ages having having passed since it went off. Barlo and I were pulled out of our seats. Dragged to the door that had swung open. Through the dust we saw the bricks in a mound upon the floor. Becky, if she was there lay under them. I thought I heard a groan. Barlo, mumbling something, threw his Bible on the pile. (No one has ever touched it.) Somehow we got away. My buggy was still on the road. The last thing I remember was whipping old Dan like fury; I remember nothing after that - that is, until I reached town and folks crowded round to get the true word of it.
