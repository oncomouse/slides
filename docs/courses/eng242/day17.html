    ## Imagism
    
    1. Direct treatment of the "thing" whether subjective or objective.
    2. To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.
    3. As regarding rhythm: to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome
    
    The Image: "that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time."

    ## William Carlos Williams
    
    >  I felt at once that _The Waste Land_ had set me back twenty years and I'm sure it did. Critically, Eliot returned us to the classroom just at the moment when I felt we were on a point to escape to matters much closer to the essence of a new art form itself—rooted in the locality which should give it fruit.
