## Paper #1 – English Studies Story

> Create a story that shows why you became an English major. The story can be fictional or true. The story can be as funny or as serious as you want. The story does not have to directly answer the question of why you became an English major. The story does not have to be a narrative. The story does not have to be prose. The story does not have to be written.

## Moments of Being

> A great part of every day is not lived consciously. One walks, eats, sees things, deals with what has to be done. . . . Then, for no reason that I know about, there was a sudden violent shock; something happened so violently that I have remembered it all my life. (70-71)
>
> Many bright colours; many distinct sounds; some human beings, caricatures; comic; several violent moments of being, always including a circle of the scene which they cut out: and all surrounded by a vast space—that is a rough visual description of childhood. (79)
>
> —Virginia Woolf, “A Sketch from the Past,” *Moments of Being* (1940)

## What's an Image?

## Ezra Pound on Images

> An “Image” is that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time. I use the term “complex” rather in the technical sense employed by the newer psychologists, such as Hart, though we may not agree absolutely in our application.
>
> It is the presentation of such a “complex” instantaneously which gives that sense of sudden liberation; that sense of freedom from time limits and space limits; that sense of sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the greatest works of art.

## Plug Into the Past

> In certain favourable moods, memories—what one has forgotten—come to the top. . . . I see it—the past—as an avenue lying behind; a long ribbon of scenes, emotions. There at the end of the avenue still, are the garden and the nursery. Instead of remembering here a scene and there a sound, I shall fit a plug into a wall; and listen in to the past. I shall turn up August 1890. I feel that strong emotion must leave its trace; and it is only a question of discovering how we can get ourselves again attached to it, so that we shall be able to live our lives through from the start.

## My English Story

.context[]
.observation[]
.interpretation[]
.lessons[]
.contextContent[
I'm in CS because I think "computers are more interesting than people"

I like exploring things

Never sure what I wanted to "do with my life"
]
.observationContent[
The class is taught by Mike McCracken, who looks like a Wild West saloon keeper.

The room is a particularly "rotten egg" version of institutional beige.

]
.interpretationContent[
I've been slacking in that course

Coming to terms with the fact that I'm not a great programmer

I love computers, but hate the industry
]
.lessonsContent[
It's also important to know who you don't want to be

Cultural texts can guide our life choices
