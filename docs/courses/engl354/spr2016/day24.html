    # Jenny Edbauer, "Unframing Models of Public Distribution: From Rhetorical Situation to Rhetorical Ecologies"

    > Place becomes decoupled from the notion of situs, or fixed (series of) locations, and linked instead to the in-between en/action of events and encounters. Place becomes a space of contacts, which are always changing and never discrete. The contact between two people on a busy city street is never simply a matter of those two bodies; rather, the two bodies carry with them the traces of effects from whole fields of culture and social histories. This is what it means to say that the social field is networked, connected, rather than a matter of place, sites, and home (10)
    
    
    How does Edbauer’s theory affect how rhetoric should be taught and exercised, not only in schools, but in the larger audience of life? In schools, the triangle allows for students to easily understand that there are connections between everything without going into depth.
    
    In the larger audience of life, one can argue that everyone is a rhetorician, regardless of awareness or not. Therefore, should everyone be taught Edbauer’s theory in order to better understand that everything is “networked” and “connected” in order that they may better understand reaching consequences of actions and communication?

    > The image of a viral/genetic connection between baboon and cat (two beings that, in Chauvin's words, have absolutely nothing to do with each other) suggests a new kind of model for thinking of rhetoric's "transversal communication" and travel in the world. A given rhetoric is not contained by the elements that comprise its rhetorical situation (exigence, rhetor, audience, constraints). Rather, a rhetoric emerges already infected by the viral intensities that are circulating in the social field. Moreover, this same rhetoric will go on to evolve in a parallel ways: between two "species" that have absolutely nothing to do with each other. What is shared between them is not the situation, but certain contagions and energy. This does not mean the shared rhetoric reproduces copies or models of "original" situations (any more than the shared G virus turns a cat into a baboon). Instead, the same rhetoric might manage to infect and connect various processes, events, and bodies.  (14)
    > 
    > These various rhetorics overlap through a kind of shared contagion, though the calls for local business support, the promotion of Liberal Arts, and the encouragement of literacy are hardly overlapping in terms of their exigencies or even their audiences. At the same time, of course, the "weird rhetoric" receives an increased circulation through these kinds of affective transmission. (18) 
    ]
    
    Do you agree with the idea that rhetoric does not consist of speaker/receiver/exigencies, but rather exists in a unique and ever changing environment? In what ways has rhetoric taken on this "viral" adaptation? How has what we accept as rhetoric evolved with technological, social, and cultural "evolutions?"

    ## Simplified Communication
    
    > Warner tells us that this is why the overly simplified models of communication—often represented through the triangulated terms *sender, receiver, text*—are nothing short of a conceptual paradox. He continues, "A public seems to be self-organized by discourse, but in fact requires preexisting forms and channels of circulation" (75). Herein lies the paradox: sender-receiver models of public communication tend to identify a kind of homeostatic relationship, which simultaneously abstracts the operation of social links and circulation. The triangle of sender, receiver, text misses the concatenations that come to constitute Warner's version of a public. (6)

    ## Fluidity of Rhetoric
    
    > Although the standard models of rhetorical situation can tell us much about the elements that are involved in a particular situation, these same models can also mask the fluidity of rhetoric. Rhetorical situations involve the amalgamation and mixture of many different events and happenings that are not properly segmented into audience, text, or rhetorician. We must therefore consider whether our popular models reflect the fullness of rhetoric's operation in public. Rhetorical ecologies are co-ordinating processes, moving across the same social field and within shared structures of feeling. (20)
    ---
    ## Conglomerations / Contexts
    
    > Biesecker's critique points to the way in which various models of rhetorical situation tend to describe rhetoric as a totality of discrete elements: audience, rhetor, exigence, constraints, and text. In other words, despite their differences, these various takes on rhetorical situation tend to be rooted in the views of rhetorics as elemental conglomerations. (7)
    
    > Rather than seeing rhetoric as the totality of its discrete elements, Phelps' critique seeks to recontextualize those elements in a wider sphere of active, historical, and lived processes. That is, the elements of a rhetorical situation can be re-read against the historical fluxes in which they move. While the incarnations of rhetorical situation create complex frameworks for understanding a rhetoric's operation in a particular social scene, therefore, both Biesecker and Phelps interrogate the effects of building a model around a "conglomeration" of distinct elements in relation to one another. (8)

    ## Shorthand
    
    > Their analysis thus suggests a problem of location; the exigence does not exist per se, but is instead an amalgamation of processes and encounters: concerns about safe neighborhoods, media images, encounters of everyday life in certain places, concerns about re-election, articulations of problems and the circulation of those articulations, and so forth. The exigence is not properly located in any element of the model. Instead, what we dub exigence is more like a shorthand way of describing a series of events. The rhetorical situation is part of what we might call, borrowing from Phelps, an ongoing social flux. Situation bleeds into the concatenation of public interaction. Public interactions bleed into wider social processes. *The elements of rhetorical situation simply bleed*. (8-9)

    ## City and Ecology
    
    > Yet Amin and Thrift suggest that the city-as-container does not adequately describe the city as an amalgam of processes, or as a circulation of encounters and actions. Rather than relying upon the container metaphor, therefore, they offer up an ecological metaphor in order to read the cities ... Though cities are indeed sites (or can even be described in terms of borders, boundaries, and containers), Amin and Thrift suggest that these sites (the situs) are sustained by the amalgam of processes, which can be described in ecological terms of varying intensities of encounters and interactions much like a weather system. (11-12)
    
    ---
    ## Rhetoric as Verb
    
    > Rather than imagining the rhetorical situation in a relatively closed system, this distributed or ecological focus might begin to imagine the situation within an open network. Returning to Amin and Thrift's notion of a city as a weather system, or an agglomeration of processes, we recall how we saw that "city" might better be conceptualized in terms of a verb as in to city as opposed to a noun. This grammatical oddity parallels the ways we speak in terms of rhetoric as a verb: we do rhetoric, rather than (just) finding ourselves in a rhetoric. By extension, we might also say that rhetorical situation is better conceptualized as a mixture of processes and encounters; it should become a verb, rather than a fixed noun or situs. (13)

    ## Contagion
    
    > These various rhetorics overlap through a kind of *shared contagion*, though the calls for local business support, the promotion of Liberal Arts, and the encouragement of literacy are hardly overlapping in terms of their *exigencies* or even their *audiences*. At the same time, of course, the "weird rhetoric" receives an increased circulation through these kinds of affective transmission. (18)

    ## Weird Expansion
    
    > While walking along the one of the main city streets of central Austin one spring day, I stumbled across a piece of white paper pasted on the side of a newspaper stand. In all block letters, the words read: "Keep Austin fucking normal. Conform. It's just easier." Upon seeing a picture of this homemade sign, my friend laughingly commented, "Doesn't this person realize just how weird this sign is?" While my friend meant this comment in jest, it addresses another aspect of what I call "rhetorical ecologies." Not only do these counter-rhetorics directly respond to and resist the original exigence, they also expand the lived experience of the original rhetorics by adding to them even while changing and expanding their shape. The anti-weird rhetorics of Austin add to the "weird rhetoric" ecology through a practice of mixture and encounters of extended proximity. (19)
    
    ---
    ## Rhetoric Between
    
    > When we temporarily bracket the discrete elements of rhetor, audience, and exigence in the "Keep Austin Weird" movement, we attune to the processes that both comprise and extend the rhetorics. Indeed, the rhetorical process itself plays out between the sites of these elements: the call is currently circulating on shirts and cars, it is mocked and pushed against, and it is distributed across purposes and institutional spaces. It circulates in a wide ecology of rhetorics. To play off Shaviro's words, the force of "messages," as they accrete over time, determine the shape of public rhetoric. (19-20)</textarea>
