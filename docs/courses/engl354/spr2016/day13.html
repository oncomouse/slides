    # Richard Vatz, "The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation"
    ---
    ## Discussion Leader (Drew)
    
    > The ethical implications for this rhetorical perspective of meaning are crucial. If one accepts Bitzer's position that “the presence of rhetorical discourse obviously indicates the presence of a rhetorical situation,” then we ascribe little responsibility to the rhetor with respect to what he has chosen to give salience. On the other hand if we view the communication of an event as a choice, interpretation, and translation, the rhetor's responsibility is of supreme concern. Thus, when there are a few speeches on hunger, and when the individual crime and not the corporate crime is the dominant topic of speakers and newspaper and magazine writers, we will not assume it is due to the relative or misreading of the “exigences.” Instead the choices will be seen as purposeful acts for discernible reasons. They are decisions to make salient or not to make salient these situations. (158)
    
    Can not decisions for what topic is important be influenced by previous rhetoric? Does the author ignore deeper context, or further reinforce the narrowness of usable context in rhetoric?

    ## Discussion Leader (Linda)
    
    > As Edelman states “… political beliefs, perceptions and expectations are overwhelmingly not based upon observation or empirical evidence available to participants, but rather upon cuings among groups of people who jointly create the meanings they will read into current and anticipated events… The particular meanings that are consensually accepted need not therefore be cued by the objective situation; they are rather established by a process of mutual agreement upon significant symbols.” (159)
    
    When are cues misleading to others or what is an example of when they are independent of each other?

    ## Phenomenology?
    
    > The Statements may ostensibly describe situations, but they actually only inform us as to the phenomenological perspective of the speaker. There can be little argument that the speakers believe they feel fear or embarrassment. Their Statements do not, however, tell us about qualities within the situation. (154)

    ## Situation Independent
    
    > The same goes for the attribution of traits to a situation. It is a fit- ting of a scene into a category or categories found in the head of the observer. No situation can have a nature independent of the perception of its interpreter or independent of the rhetoric with which he chooses to characterize it. (154)
    ---
    ## Meaning and Residue
    
    >  Bitzer's perspective emanates from his view of the nature of meaning. Simply stated, Bitzer takes the position that meaning resides in events. As sociologist Herbert Blumer describes this point of view, it is "to regard meaning as intrinsic to the thing that has it, as being a natural part of the objective makeup of the thing. Thus, a chair is clearly a chair in itself, a cow a cow, a rebellion a rebellion, and so forth. Being inherent in the thing that has it, meaning needs merely to be disengaged by observing the objective thing that has the meaning. The meaning emanates, so to speak, from the thing, and as such there is no process involved in its formation; all that is necessary is to recognize the meaning that is there in the thing." This is Bitzer's point of view: There is an intrinsic nature in events from which rhetoric inexorably follows, or should follow (155)

    ## Waiting to be Done
    
    >  Not only is a "waiting to be done" now existing in the event, but we also learn that it contains an ethical imperative supposedly independent of its Interpreters. Bitzer adds that the situation is rhetorical only if something *can* be done, but apparently it is only rhetorical also if something *should* be done. Bitzer seems to imply that the "positive modification" needed for an exigence is clear. He seems to reflect what Richard Weaver called a "melioristic bias." We learn for example, that the obvious posi- tive modification of pollution of our air is "reduction of pollution." One wonders what the obvious "positive modification" of the military-industrial complex is. (156)
    ---
    ## Meaning vs Mediation (Context vs Situation)
    
    >  Fortunately or unfortunately meaning is not intrinsic in events, facts, people, or "situations" nor are facts "publicly observable." Except for those situations which directly confront our own empirical reality, we learn of facts and events through someone's communicating them to us. This involves a two-part process. First, there is a choice of events to communicate. The world is not a plot of discrete events. The world is a scene of inexhaustible events which ail compete to impinge on what Kenneth Burke calls our "sliver of reality."
    
    > Bitzer argues that the nature of the context determines the rhetoric. But one never runs out of context. (156)

    ## Sifting
    
    >  Murray Edelman points out in *Politics as Symbolic Action*, "People can use only an infinitesimal fraction of the information reaching them. The criticai question, therefore, is what accounts for the choice by politicai spectators and participants of what to organize into a meaningful structure and what to ignore." Any rhetor is involved in this sifting and choosing, whether it be the newspaper editor choosing front-page stories versus comic-page stories or the speaker highlighting facts about a person in a eulogy. (156)

    ## Created by Rhetors
    
    >  To the audience, events become meaningful only through their linguistic depiction. As Edelman points out, "Politicai events can become infused with strong affect stemming from psychic tension, from perceptions of economie, military, or other threats or opportunities, and from interactions between social and psychological responses. These politicai 'events,' however, are largely creations of the language used to describe them." Therefore, meaning is not discovered in situations, but created by rhetors. (157)
    ---
    ## Rhetoric Creates Reality?
    
    > There are criticai academic and moral consequences for rhetorical study according to one's view of meaning. If you view  meaning as intrinsic to situations, rhetorical study becomes parasitic to philosophy, politicai science, and whatever other discipline can inform us as to what the "real" situation is. If, on the other hand, you view meaning as a consequence of rhetorical creation, your paramount concern will be how and by whom symbols create the reality to which people react. In a world of inexhaustible and ambiguous events, facts, images, and symbols, the rhetorician can best account for choices of situations, the evocative symbols, and the forms and media which transmit these translations of meaning. Thus, if anything, a rhetorical basis of meaning requires a disciplinary hierarchy with rhetoric at the top. (157-158)

    class: big
    ## Rhetoric as Moral Sifting
    
    >  To view rhetoric as a creation of reality or salience rather than a reflector of reality clearly increases the rhetor's moral responsibility. We do not just have the academie exercise of determining whether the rhetor understood the "situation" correctly. Instead, he must assume responsibility for the salience he has created. The potential culpability of John F. Kennedy in the "missile crisis" is thus much greater. The journalists who choose not to investigate corruption in government or the health needs of the elderly are also potentially more culpable. In short, the rhetor is responsible for what he chooses to make salient. (158)

    ## Stable?
    
    >  Bitzer refers to the Controlling situation of President Kennedy's assassination. The creation of salience for certain types of events such as Presidential assassinations may be so ritualized that it is uninteresting to analyze it rhetorically. This does not mean, however, that the situation "controlled" the response. It means that the communication of the event was of such consensual symbolism that expectations were easily predictable and stable. (160)

    class: big
    ## Rhetorical Fear
    
    > Surely Bitzer cannot believe that there was an intrinsic urgency which compelled the rotunda speeches following the killing of President Kennedy (note, that the killing of important people is communicated with the evocative term "assassination"). In fact, the killing of a president of this country at this time is not a real threat to the people in any measurable way. How smooth in fact is the transference of power. How similar the country is before and after the event. (How similar are the President and Vice-President?) *But* since rhetoric *created* fears and threat perception, the rotunda speeches were needed to communicate reassurances. (160)</textarea>
