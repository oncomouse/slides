    ## Discussion Leader (McKenna)
    
    > Ian Bogost has argued for an approach to rhetorical activity that he calls “procedural rhetoric,” which is defined as a means by which an argument can be composed in order to help an audience understand how to engage with a particular system, world, or line of thought. (Brock)
    
    > At first glance, an argument that aligns rhetoric with machines, rules, or procedures would seem to be another of rhetoric’s reductions, an attempt to rein in rhetoric and to take away the rhetor’s spontaneity. But what we learn from something like YourLetterBot is that there is value in tracing and embracing rhetoric’s machinic roots. As *limitrophe*, this robot rhetor is another reminder that the boundaries between human and nonhuman continue to proliferate. (Brown 511)
    
    Is this actually another of rhetorics reductions or do you think that aligning rhetoric with these things will actually enhance rhetor’s spontaneity? Do you believe that thinning the boundaries between human and nonhuman regarding rhetoric is beneficial to human development and evolution or not? Do you think these tools like YourLetterBot are something that you would utilize? Do you think that they should be included more in rhetoric/English classes?

    ## Discussion Leader (Emily)
    
    > As *limitrophe*, this robot rhetor is another reminder that the boundaries between human and nonhuman continue to proliferate. The increasing number of robot rhetors—software that composes news stories and academic articles, Google search algorithms, robots that trawl (or perhaps troll?) Wikipedia—lends urgency to this project, meaning that the robot sits alongside the nonhuman animal as a reminder that extrahuman rhetorical relations are, in Derrida’s words, “passing through the most unusual phase in which we now find ourselves, and for which we have no scale (Brown 511).
    
    As robot rhetors continue to gain popularity in everyday society, can we as humans learn to understand rhetoric as a procedural and computational movement in which we write alongside machines? At some point will technology begin to understand rhetoric more precisely than humans? Do you think technology already has this understanding? Do you believe that we have a different interpretation of rhetoric than technology?

    ## What is an Algorithm?
    
    > Algorithmic procedure fundamentally involves a set of operations meant to complete a task. These operations demand the computation of one or more variables for the operations to be successfully examined, undertaken, and completed. Usually, algorithms are considered within the domains of mathematics, computer science, and electrical or computer engineering; however, algorithms are not always so restrictively defined. As Christopher Steiner has noted, “Algorithms needn’t involve graduate school math or even math at all. The Babylonians employed algorithms in matters of law, ancient teachers of Latin checked grammar using algorithms, . . . and countless numbers of men from all corners of the Earth have used them in an attempt to predict the future” (54). Algorithms are then not restricted to engineers or mathematicians as tools for describing particular situations and the potential ways those situations might be addressed. (Brock 1-2)
    ---
    ## Enthymeme as Algorithm
    
    > Rhetors have at their disposal a powerful algorithmic procedure that exists at the very heart of rhetorical activity alongside the example; as Aristotle noted, “All [speakers] produce logical persuasion by means of paradigms or enthymemes and by nothing other than these” (Aristotle I.ii.8). Specifically, I refer to the “enthymeme” as a rhetorical algorithm, an incomplete syllogism whose implicit, unstated completion is realized only when an audience is persuaded to perform that completion—optimally in a manner aligned with a rhetor’s intent. What a rhetor can do with that enthymeme depends on whether the audience, being inclined to accept the basic premises of the argument, has successfully computed the necessary variables involved and their operations of delivery. (Brock 2)

    ## Audience as Computer
    
    > This example is incredibly simple, but it demonstrates a point central to the idea of rhetoric as algorithmic: there is a logical procedure to be constructed that extends from the first moments of invention through the rhetor’s inevitable delivery of his or her message. Further, its execution must be played out in the mind of the audience in order to be considered successful as a component of the overall persuasive effort. (Brock 2)
    ---
    ## Argument From Probability
    
    > While this statement can be formed into an imperative (“Visit the grocery store”), it is flexible enough to deal with contingency and probability—, which is exactly the sort of algorithmic problem solving that informs heuristic processes of rhetorical invention. If a political candidate speaks to Democratic party supporters, then that candidate probably should not argue for limiting government funding for social programs—that is, he or she should not do so if the candidate wants the support of that audience for his or her candidacy. If an academic speaks to a public audience about the impact of highly technical research in biomedical engineering, then he or she probably should use language accessible to a broad community rather than engineering jargon to improve the chances that the audience will understand the academic’s point. One can make an argument that goes against these evaluations—the condition does not prevent the possibility of divergence or rejection. (Brock 3)

    ## A Collection of Machines
    
    > This discussion of the procedures that infect writing programs my own article, which comes after some of the machinic roots of the rhetorical tradition. Rhetoricians never tire of defining rhetoric, so I offer my own definition hesitantly, but let me suggest that rhetoric is a collection of machines (“whatsits,” “gadgets”) for generating and interpreting arguments. The virus that infects Derrida’s inventional and interpretive mechanisms is rhetorical and procedural. It is mechanical, operating by certain logics, taking inputs and generating outputs. This makes the rhetorician squirm, since describing rhetoric in terms of procedures might be seen as reducing the art to mere rules. (Brown 496)
    ---
    ## The Robot Rhetor
    
    > If I am merely “following procedure,” then I am not making ethical judgments. I am off-loading ethics onto the machine.
    > 
    > However, rules are not only followed. They are also authored. This is of particular importance when we begin to notice the computational machines that write alongside us every day, the ones that Derrida invokes in his discussion of the computer virus that helped compose *The Animal That Therefore I Am* ... As Kennedy demonstrates, these mechanisms are both writing and written, and Wikipedia’s policies recognize this by seeing bots as both “users” (they have user pages, just like their human counterparts) and as tools. They are examples of what I’m calling the “robot rhetor,” a term I use to describe any entity that “machines” language. The robot rhetor takes input, applies procedures, and generates output. As we will see, this definition means that it becomes quite difficult to draw any clear line between human and robot, although as Derrida makes clear, the line does have be posited in order to be able to claim it can’t be drawn clearly. (Brown 497)

    ## Rhetorical Action is Machinic
    
    > King forces us to consider whether understanding rhetoric as procedural, algorithmic, machinic, and computational can account for the need to shift rhetorical strategies in the face of context and *kairos*, a question that the present article takes up by way of Erasmus and *copia*. As does King, I see rhetorical education as providing a set of procedures from which the rhetor/ician chooses. And as Bogost argues, what we typically think of as “breaking procedure” is actually just the process of crafting and implementation of a new procedure (2007, 6). In this sense, all rhetorical action (even that which emerges in an instant, in response to *kairos*) is machinic. (Brown 498)
    ---
    ## Machining Eloquence
    
    > Given that today’s rhetorical ecologies are increasingly populated by computational machines, it has become imperative that rhetorical theory address the robot rhetor. De copia, I suggest, provides evidence that the rhetorician has long been interested in machinic procedures; this interest, I further maintain, opens the door to an understanding of computation as rhetorical and of every rhetor as robotic, a computer that machines language. De copia offers conceptual machines for the generation and maintenance of eloquence, and revisiting these machines helps us reconsider the distinctions we draw between humans and computational mechanisms. (Brown 499)

    ## Algorithmic Training
    
    > The student, according to Erasmus, will move through space, examining commonplaces, but that process is an emergent one during which the appropriate topos will produce itself voluntarily, coming forth on its own, for its own sake, or of its own will. Further, the mechanism that induces such topoi to show themselves will eventually become unnecessary. Once trained, the proper proofs will themselves come forward. However, it is not entirely clear if the student or the topoi themselves are trained. If the proofs will eventually come forth “of their own will,” then it seems that the student is training a kind of artificial intelligence machine, one that will eventually operate “voluntarily.” (Brown 500)
    ---
    ## Machines
    
    > Erasmus crafts machines, and thankfully Knott’s translation retains those machines in all their mundanity, for they offer a reminder of rhetoric’s machinic qualities. For example, in chapter 94, Erasmus presents his “too … to” machine and some of examples of its outputs: “He is too fine a man to want to lie, too straightforward to be able to … [;] he is too proud to be prepared to be taught, too stupid to be able to learn” (473). Chapter 107, “Be Friends,” iterates various ways of describing friendship, from “I am on friendly terms with his father” to “at one time I saw a great deal of the man” (483). Each of these chapters can be seen as a miniature lesson in computer programming, since the focus is less on what emerges from the machine than on the machine itself—the rules that we might follow in order to generate copia of words and ideas ... Erasmus is demonstrating the output of these machines, but he is primarily focused on laying out his weird collection of whatsits, a curio cabinet of mechanisms that iterate through loops, spitting out arguments. (Brown 502-3)

    ## Become a Writer? Become a Robot!
    
    > One interested in developing an abundant style must exaggerate the rules, must become a robot. To become more human and more able to spontaneously respond to the kairotic situation, the student must exaggerate the robotic machinations of rhetorical study. But these exaggerations should be focused on the classroom; taking them outside of such spaces would likely result in awkward or harsh prose. Erasmus is more likely to afford the poets freedom to play with things like fables or to write about fantastical creatures such as vampires, muses, and graces or ideas like fortune, love, poverty, and wealth (582–83). Orators might explore this territory, but rather than using a “less natural” fable that “attributes speech to inanimate objects such as trees or stone,” the orator will more likely deal with people, using prosographia to paint a person “in all his colours” (585–86). (Brown 504)

    ## Carpentry
    
    > For Bogost, carpentry is the crafting of objects that provide fuzzy, distorted, speculative insight into the worlds of objects. Carpentry offers an alternative mode of doing philosophy, a different way of caring for the world that extends philosophical inquiry beyond text and language ... Carpentry speculates about the worlds of objects (human and otherwise) in an attempt to understand extrahuman rhetorical relations. (Brown 499)
    ---
    ## Widespread Virus
    
    > And if we understand all objects—not just computational machines—as difference engines, as entities that translate the world around them, then YourLetterBot not only sheds light on the robot rhetor but on the mechanics of objects in general. What YourLetterBot shows us is not that we should consider robots to be like humans but rather that what we thought was a defining characteristic of the human, writing, is in fact a much more widespread virus. As we attempt to track that virus and its various appearances, we can draw on rhetoric’s machinic tradition, its vast library of mechanisms, to make sense of not only how the robot rhetor operates but how any number of rhetorical devices exert force on the world.
