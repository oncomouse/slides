    ## How Does Technology Change Writing?
    
    1. Ong: Writing restructures consciousness. Writing technologies create new lifeworlds
    1. Lanham: "Bistable Decorum"
    	* **Looking at**: text as form, text as shape
    	* **Looking through**: text as content delivery

    ## Ong (Again)
    
    > In downgrading writing, Plato was thinking of writing as an external, alien technology, as many people today think of the computer. Because we have by today so deeply interiorized writing, made it so much a part of ourselves, as Plato's age had not yet made it fully a part of itself, we find it difficult to consider writing to be a technology as we commonly assume printing and the computer to be. Yet writing (and especially alphabetic writing) is a technology, calling for the use of tools and other equipment, styli or brushes or pens, carefully prepared surfaces such as paper, animal skins, strips of wood, as well as inks or paints, and much more. Writing tech- nologies have differed in different parts of the world. In their own indigenous technologies of writing, East Asia-China, Korea, and Japan-typically used not pens but brushes, not liquid ink in ink-horns or inkwells, but ink blocks, on which the wet brush was rubbed as in making water-colour paintings, in this sense 'painting' rather than 'writing' (etymologically, 'scratching') their texts.

    What might writing look like when we are no longer bound to paper?

    # So, How Can I Make This?
    ---
    class: bigger
    ## Prezi
    
    Fairly easy to use visual storytelling / presentation platform. Useful for manipulating / exploring spatial data spaces.
    
    [Prezi](http://prezi.com)

    ## Twine
    
    Interactive story generator. Used to make the *Castle, Forest, Island, Sea* on the previous slide.
    
    Easily create user-explored narrative spaces.
    
    [Read more about it here.](http://twinery.org/) And the [Guide](http://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide).

    ## Tracery
    
    Library that does "generative grammars" (which is fancy, computer science term for "makes sentences"). Can be used to generate a variety of complex stuff. (This is fairly advanced)
    
    [A few examples](http://www.brightspiral.com/)

    ## Assignment #3
    
    For this assignment, you will be asked to use think about rhetoric in the wild (ie. as it is used every day). To do this, you may use any framework or concept we have discussed (Mountford's notion of space, the rhetorical situation, Rice's ecologies, bistable decorum, etc). Specifically, this assignment challenges you to explore the rhetorical function, language, forces, etc. present in a space, classroom, organization, piece of official writing, discourse community, or other artifact at A&M. Rather than write a research paper, this project asks you to be descriptive *and* analytical as you consider how rhetoric functions in the wild. This project may (and should) incorporate multimedia aspects and does not need to be merely a paper, if you like.
    
    You may either produce one document—an essay that uses whatever prose style you deem appropriate to explore your subject's use of rhetoric—*or* you will produce two documents—an object that explores your subject and a brief (2-3 page) statement that explains your intent behind creating the object. This object may be a video, a Powerpoint presentation, a podcast, a Prezi, a Twine game, a generative poem, a collection of short stories or other creative writing, a painting, a chapbook, etc.</textarea>
