    ## Discussion Leader (Colton)
    
    >The space of the page—whether practiced in composition or other areas of college English—is tied to the single author, the individual who works in one fixed space within a fixed disciplinary focus with a single identity tied to a singly motivated reading practice tied to a single idea expressed at a single moment. That is a concept already familiar to college English. The space somewhere else, which Bartholomae dismisses, is the open space constructed out of connections where multiple writers engaging within multiple ideas in multiple media at multiple moments function. (Rice 130)
    
    How has college English ever been singular, in any sense that Rice uses, when things like the 1640s and English Interregnum pamphlet wars were studied? When things like early modern folios produced by a myriad of artists, craftsmen, printers, and authors were studied? When poetry, prose, songs, prayer hymns, novels, and letters were studied? Why can't the internet be another example of emergent or alternative media?

    ## Discussion Leader (Veronica)
    
    >He contends that whereas "established knowledge" situated learning in predictable and fixed ways, networks of ever-different data mean that knowledge will always be in flux (Lyotard 53). That one can study and work with a body always in flux, always unstable, and always shifting is a paradox because higher education has meant the mastery of a mostly stable body of information (131)
    
    > The network, therefore, does not require learning the truths of ideas, but rather how ideas fluctuate in specific types of spaces and contexts (131)
    
    As a college English student, how would you propose the teaching of something that is always changing and fluctuating? Furthermore, even if you find merit in this kind of redefining of English studies, would you want this taught? Would it be a required English course or would it be a separate course? What do you think are the benefits of being taught that everything is connected and in constant motion?

    ## Network as Media
    
    > Making that claim is not a rejection of current work but rather a desire to draw attention to one aspect of new media, the network, whose role in shaping and sharing information continues to increase within the media world we inhabit. In particular, the network manifests itself online on the Web, via social software in stand-alone and Web applications, through e-mail, within databases, within marketing, through public policy, and among other related new media applications and experiences. "Our culture's practical engagement with such digital forms as the World Wide Web," Jay David Bolter writes, "may compel us to rethink the relationship of media theory and practice in the humanities" (16). For the question of what college English should be, I want to narrow Bolter's claim by imagining his call as one for networks. (127)
    ---
    ## Network as Apparatus
    
    > Networks foreground the role connectivity plays in content management, information organization, and information production in explicit and implicit ways. When I participate in an online service like Livejournal, Facebook, or MySpace, I engage with a series of interconnected encounters at the level of personality, writing, interest, politics, and taste. The moment I view an advertisement on TV, in the movie theater, or on the Web, and that ad calls to me (purchase this product/identify with it), I enter into an economic and emotional connection with new media production. When I make a purchase on any of the online services such as Amazon, Overstock, or eBay, I work within a networked path of associations and connections, all of which draw upon my past habits and direct me to a variety of products and finks the services provide. All of these kinds of activities interlink information and users of information in ways English studies has not yet fully explored. (128)
    ---
    ## English Studies as Old Media
    
    > These activities foreground how relationships function in new media experiences. "I think therefore I connect with all the other cognizers in my environment," Katherine Hayles writes, noting that linking?conceptually and practically?offers an emerging form of expression (213). Whereas traditionally English studies has considered the ways relationships and connections work between texts and race, gender, or class (cultural studies), how connections affect critique (critical pedagogy), or the roles connections play in cultural analysis (articulation), it has not yet imagined connectivity as the place of college English itself. College English has not yet imagined or perceived itself as a network. (128)
    ---
    ## Network as Structure / Metaphor
    
    > What Barabási calls the "eye," I generalize as an emerging sense of perception shaped by connections. This type of perception may be filtered, as in a Google search that connects vast amounts of information and displays it through an interface, or it may result in open-ended information, as a wiki might generate through a never-ending array of internal links and open editing. Or it may involve a complete reworking of how information is classified and stored, as the emerging practice of folksonomy, a system where anyone can attach any term to any piece of information, does in a direct challenge to referential organizational systems. What I call the network are these spaces—literal or figurative—of connectivity. (128)
    ---
    ## Fear of the New
    
    >  every effort to understand new communicative innovations comes with well-placed fears and concerns. Network criticism often focuses on the continuation of capitalist marketing and branding, the consolidation of intellectual property into one controlled hub, or the hegemony of political inequity. Debates on the nettime-1 discussion list, for instance, often critique networked exchanges of cultural workers and industrial power by arguing that increases in informational exchanges lead to oppressive working conditions for those who are not contributing to a given network, but rather are being used by it. (129)
    ---
    ## It's Here
    
    > In other words, it is important to remain aware of how networks may institutionalize practices and beliefs deemed negative, but it is just as important to realize that "potentials" are still in circulation. Whether for good or for bad, the network is reimagining social and informational relationships so profoundly that even if the discipline of English studies remains wary of the network and suspicious of its place within the curriculum, the field can still benefit from learning how networks alter both understandings of writing and writing itself. (129)
    ---
    ## Writing is *so* Over
    
    > English studies maintains a fixed point of view through a singular notion of writing as static, fixed, and individually composed (typically via the essay or the exam), taking place in a unified realm of thought deemed "English." The definitions of "writing" produced in this economy of thought (response essay, analytical paper, personal essay) no longer serve the media society of networks and connections contemporary culture generates *as these definitions of writing are now performed*. The time has come to rethink the metaphor of writing because its image is too structured around fixity. "The age of writing has passed," McLuhan writes, "we must invent a new metaphor, restructure our thoughts and feelings" (17). We must invent a new metaphor because, on its own, "writing" feels too limited in an age of total information delivery and connectivity. (129)
    ---
    ## New Relationships
    
    >  Burroughs understood the implications computing would eventually have for meaning making, whether that influence be explicit (using a computer) or implicit (being affected by other forces shaped by computing). He also drew attention not only to how a media being is a person fully engaged with networked rhetorics, but also to how institutional beings (governments, commerce, education) change within networks as each body is placed into a new type of relationship with the others. Associations, combinations, and juxtapositions contribute to a methodology of connectivity. To work in the network, either to extend its functions or to resist its functions, as Burroughs advocated, means also understanding and learning this methodology. (130)
    ---
    ## The Space of the Page
    
    >  The space of the page—whether practiced in composition or other areas of college English—is tied to the single author, the individual who works in one fixed space within a fixed disciplinary focus with a single identity tied to a singly motivated reading practice tied to a single idea expressed at a single moment. That is a concept already familiar to college English. The space somewhere else, which Bartholomae dismisses, is the open space constructed out of connections where multiple writers engaging within multiple ideas in multiple media at multiple moments function. That space somewhere else is the network. "Now we make our networks, and our networks make us," William Mitchell argues (49). In that process of making networks, writers, through their work, see themselves connected to information in ways the space on the page does not allow. The space on the page keeps bodies of information (and, thus, bodies) separate. (130)
    ---
    ## "Social"
    
    > In contrast, networks alter current understandings regarding how learning functions in social spaces. By social, I do not mean "people," "friendliness," or "mingling." Instead, I mean the ways bodies of information socialize, the ways they interact, or, as Burroughs wrote, the ways they associate. Socialization is inherently neither a good nor a bad act; it is, instead, a process of working with information. More is implied in such statements than collaboration or being online or even using a computer. A more complete understanding regarding how information connects in ways traditional English studies does not yet account for—the contradictory, overlapping, open, closed, and fluctuating systems of exchanges that networks create—is a challenge to the disciplinary identity of English as a field and to the identities that teachers and scholars in English embrace and request students to take on in their classrooms. (130-1)

    ## Network?
    
    > Writing as network is a complicated act; the ways that networks structure selves and rhetorical output still need unpacking and further study. Is the network a set of activities? Is it a practice? Is it an emerging body of work? Is it a type of linkage beyond hyperlinks? Is it the totality of all of these points?</textarea>
