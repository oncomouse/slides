    # Mountford <br> "On Gender and Rhetorical Space"
    ---
    ## Discussion Leader (Zach)
    
    > Rhetorical space is an extraordinarily important aspect of rhetorical performance, but especially in sacred locations, where each object and participant are set in place according to the rituals performed in that space. One of the categories of “placement” employed in sacred places is gender hierarchy; another is separation of sacred leaders and people. (62)
    
    Roxanne Mountford discusses the pulpit as a rhetorical space. She shows how the pulpit amplifies a character’s gender, gender hierarchy, and status. How does Mountford demonstrate this to the audience? Why do you think Mountford picked a pulpit as the rhetorical space to focus on? Do you agree with Mountford’s argument? Why or why not? Can you think of any other rhetorical spaces that have a similar effect on rhetorical performance?

    ## "Space"
    
    > When scholars write about "space," they most often use the term metaphorically to describe the cultural landscape of laws, customs, and beliefs that form the geographies of our lives. (41)
    ---
    ## Discussion Leader (Bekah)
    
    On page 46 Mountford asserts that the placement of women in un-intuitional, organic, domestic, and natural settings does not “suggest that these women preachers are without authority.” A few sentences later, however, she concludes almost the opposite - that their wisdom is “fleeting.” How do you think the domestic positioning of women, especially in Mountford’s example texts, affects their authority over their audiences?

    ## The Cultural
    
    > The cultural is the grid across which we measure and interpret space, but also the nexus from which creative minds manipulate material space. The material—a dimension too little theorized by rhetoricians—often has unforeseen influence over a communicative event and cannot always be explained by cultural or creative intent. (42)

    ## Why Fiction?
    
    > So why turn to literary examples to explore a real-life phenomenon: the gendered nature of the pulpit? Because writers, like all spectators of life, offer a fresh lens for understanding the nature of rhetoric. As Thomas Farrell has said so well, the exploration of public oratory goes on without the help of specialists, for through "habituated capacity as an audience," all spectators understand intuitively what moves them in a speech (12). These are not obscure matters for audiences. Who better to explain what the rest of us intuit than a novelist? (48)

    ## Space Communicates
    
    > Through this literary exaggeration of a common rhetorical space, Melville illustrates a profoundly important matter about the nature of pulpits: as architecture they communicate something to the audience quite apart from the sermon itself. They have communicative powers of their own. Melville demonstrates the importance of this principle by devoting an entire chapter to the description of Father Mapple's pulpit. (48)
    ---
    ## Some Vocabulary
    
    > The "social imaginary" is, therefore, the cultural dimension of space: it is that sense of locations as having hierarchies and forming relationships between human residents. (49)
    
    > But he goes further, mapping the material dimensions of such spaces as nature, buildings, the space between natural and built structures, the insides of buildings, furniture. For Lefebvre material space and the social imaginary work in tandem: material spaces can trigger the social imaginary because of the historical and cultural freight attached to the space. For example, when I see a church, I think "location for Christian worship," whether or not the church is still being used for religious purposes. (49)

    ## Spatial Symbolism
    
    > These spaces "resonate," suggests Lefebvre, with symbolism, symbolism that is not lost on spectators and inhabitants. But they are also ordinary in their materiality: one looks up and says "Wow" because of verticality. One stands near the apple cart and feels an intimacy with the preacher because she is physically close. (50)

    ## Space and Function and Purpose
    
    > Spaces have heuristic power over their inhabitants and spectators by forcing them to change both their behavior (walls cause us to turn right or left; skyscrapers draw the eye up) and, sometimes, their view of themselves. Lefebvre writes, "In an apartment building comprising stack after stack of 'boxes for living in,' for example, the spectators-cum-tenants grasp the relationship between part and whole directly; furthermore, they recognize themselves in that relationship" (98). The apartment building includes one identical apartment after another; tenants are like so many drones in a hive. (50)

    ## In One's Place
    
    > To have one's "place" be silence makes no sense unless we imagine that silence attached to a rhetorical situation that necessarily involves material space: a woman sitting silently in a church pew while a man preaches. The trope of "place" makes social position and location interchangeable. (52)
    
    > While we are accustomed to the trope "women's place," we might ask ourselves why it is that gender hierarchies are so persistently associated with geography. Throughout history and across cultures, women have been ritually separated from men in certain sacred places. (53)
    ---
    ## Ritual and Sacredness
    
    > For example, the flag of the United States, in reality just a tri-colored cloth, is made sacred by the rituals attached to it. According to military protocol, the flag must be placed to the right of the speaker when displayed during a speech, and it must never be flown outside during the rain, touch the ground, or be worn as a garment. When the flag is hoisted on a pole and put into the ground during or after a battle, it is marking the ground beneath it as American territory. To an outsider unfamiliar with the symbolic importance of the flag, these procedures might seem like "micro-adjustments": why not put the flag to the left of the speaker? Why can the flag be burned when it is decommissioned but not touch the ground when it is "on duty"? The answer is that the rituals themselves make the object sacred. When the sacred space is a building, such as a church, it is the placement of objects and persons within it that contribute to its sacred status. (54)
    ---
    ## Space as Constraint
    
    > In the instances when she could not leave the pulpit, she preached an expository sermon, tightly focused on explication of scripture, because the populist sermons she preferred could not be "pulled off' if she could not leave the pulpit and move in toward the people. In a church with a long, narrow nave (the portion of the church where the congregation is seated), she needed to use the pulpit to be seen and heard. Conversely, a shallow nave with pews radiating out from the sanctuary gave her the opportunity to walk out to the people and make eye contact. "The architecture of a church affects what kinds of sermons I can preach," she announced. So profound is the pulpit and its placement in space that for this preacher, her entire rhetorical performance is affected-including the content of the sermon. (58)
    
    > Margaret Ballard Hess recalls a woman in her homiletics class who preached her first sermon. "She literally clutched the sides of the pulpit, as if she were hanging on for dear life," Hess writes. "Her face was quite animated and expressive, but she hardly moved her body at all. She later shared that when she stepped into the pulpit, she immediately felt constricted." (63)</textarea>
