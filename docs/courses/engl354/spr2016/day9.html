    # Marback <br> "Rhetoric at the End of History"
    ---
    ## Discussion Leaders (Heidi)
    
    > In this passage in particular, Schiappa makes a variety of moves that make debates about historiography both narrow and broad, insignificant and important. What seems to matter most to Schiappa is the otherness of ancient texts: we must acknowledge their absolute difference. What makes this stance paradoxical is that the otherness of the texts, their difference from us, must also somehow provide facts, persuasive facts, that support and are supported by the rhetorical conventions of history. In other words, the inscrutable otherness of the past is such because the rhetorical conventions of history situate the past as simultaneously alien and yet knowable, available for colonization. (81)
    
    So, do you think there is a formula so to speak for certain situations in rhetoric or types of rhetoric that require either a “fact” or “fiction” theory? Also, pushing the margins how far do you think one can go into these two sides of essentialism or constructionism before they are considered too extreme and therefore wrong?

    ## Discussion Leaders (Joe)
    
    > But we should keep in mind as well Franz Fanon's remark, "I would be very happy to know that a correspondence had flourished between some Negro philosopher and Plato. But I can absolutely not see how this fact would change anything in the lives of the eight-year-old children who labor in the cane fields of Martinique or Guadeloupe. No attempt must be made to encase man, for it is his destiny to be set free” (230). A different view of Plato will not directly change the material conditions of colonialism. Still, we can write Plato differently in histories of rhetoric, describing in narratives of Plato the terms that justify colonial practices, tracing our participation in those historiographies, and opening the space for histories that might authorize redistribution of the privilege that encases some and not others. (87)
    
    What exactly does Marback mean by “material conditions”? Does this “material condition” affect our understanding of rhetoric? What are the consequences of that? Do you believe Objectivity is possible when negotiating with “material conditions”? And what does this mean to Marback’s claim for a “redistribution of privilege”?

    ## Two Terms
    
    1. End of History
    1. Postcolonialism

    ## The End of History
    
    From Francis Fukuyama's *The End of History and the Last Man* (1992)
    
    > What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.
    
    Updated for today (2015):
    
    > The biggest single problem in societies aspiring to be democratic has been their failure to provide the substance of what people want from government: personal security, shared economic growth and the basic public services (especially education, health care and infrastructure) that are needed to achieve individual opportunity. Proponents of democracy focus, for understandable reasons, on limiting the powers of tyrannical or predatory states. But they don't spend as much time thinking about how to govern effectively. They are, in Woodrow Wilson's phrase, more interested in "controlling than in energizing government."

    ## Marback's Intervention
    
    * Three Debates
    	* Schiappa / Poulakos
    	* *Black Athena*
    	* Knoblauch and Brannon
    * Two Positions
    	* History as Fact
    	* History as Reconstruction
    
    ---
    
    ## The Problem
    
    > First, the debate between Poulakos and Schiappa, reactions to *Black Athena*, and responses to Knoblauch and Brannon independently give specific expression to the same general concerns, concerns about the relationships between our accounts of the past and our uses of those accounts to make sense of the present. Second, in each case concerns about representing the past are phrased as oppositions that pit "fact" against "fiction," calling into question the very concept of historical facticity. Third, read through each other, these three episodes move us through the problems of facticity, in the direction Schilb indicates, into issues of colonialism in the rhetoric of historiography and the historiography of rhetoric. (78)
    
    > The Poulakos/Schiappa, *Black Athena*,and Knoblauch and Brannon debates raise questions of how the past and its uses presently legitimate(intentionally or not) knowledges that perpetuate unequal acquisitions of authority and exercises of power. In all three of the cases listed above, historiographic concerns about the articulation of ancient Greece within contemporary North America become debates about whether and how historically to situate hegemonic authority in classical and modern geographic locations. (78)

    class: big
    
    ## The Stakes
    
    > The prospects of postcolonial historicizing of rhetoric lie in acts of reading rhetoric and its history as effects of cultural, institutional, and theoretical discourses that organize our disciplinary knowledge of the past in relation to current distributions and exercises of power. At the same time, the perils of theorizing history of rhetoric and the rhetoric of historiography as discursive effects lie in too quickly claiming escape from a colonizing past and in too easily denying complicity in a colonized present. (79)
    
    ---
    ## Ivory Tower
    
    > [D]ebates about uses of the first sophists have had a significant impact on the professional discourse of rhetoric. Nonetheless, when measured from outside the field of rhetoric itself, this debate seems to have had little impact. As one side of the binary of institutionalized authority, constructionist historiography, and the debates it participates in, have failed significantly to disrupt the status of historical facts and displace the authority of essentializing disciplinary discourses. Despite Crowley's contention that the emergence of constructionist historiography "foregrounds difference, variety, and change," the debate between essentialism and constructionism is itself more an expression of the present institutionalization of power than a transformation of it. (82-3)

    ## History as Authority
    
    > When history becomes a matter of understanding what count as facts—as well as a matter of sensing why those facts matter as such—acquiring the professionalized knowledge necessary to make the ancients different makes history a matter of scholastic fetish, the simple act of encasing and preserving a long-dead tradition. Doing history in this way becomes a matter of learning not to engage the past in terms of the present; rather, it becomes a matter of learning to isolate past from present. At the same time, exercising the historical authority of differentiation conceals and denies the power of the past in the present. (82)

    ## "I'm More Ethical Than You"
    
    > Welch is proposing escape from hegemonic pedagogies by encouraging us to side with Bernal and historical constructionists against essentialists and "conservatives" (41). But, as Lefkowitz and Levine argue it, acceding to Bernal is what in fact binds us to an ethically bankrupt tradition. For them, our only salvation lies in the hope for objectivity. Which side can ultimately claim the high road is yet to be seen, but I want to note here the terms of the impasse: both sides claim to be "more ethical" and "more just," claims based at one and the same time on fact and myth, essentialism and constructionism, historical reconstruction and rational reconstruction. So who is right?
    >
    > While I generally side with constructionists, the either/or option that yields constructionist historiography seems to me a dead end. Constructionism in and of itself does not help one out of being involved with or implicated in structures of racism and practices of neocolonialism. (85)
    ---
    ## Colonizing History
    
    > What matters most, then, is not the facts in and of themselves, but the rhetoric, the way the facts are narrated, the act of highlighting the interestedness of those facts as well as the racial dynamics and racist consequences of their interestedness. (86)
    
    > The past no longer presents itself to us independent of our presentation of it to ourselves and others. Constructionist or no, we still share complicity in the colonial consequences of disciplinary representations of history and rhetoric. (86)
    
    > Because the past is not simply that which is behind us, the challenge remains for us to reimagine historiographies of rhetoric at the end of history. The challenge is for us to rewrite histories of rhetoric, as they (and through them we) participate in the colonizing of history and in colonizing through uses of history.  (86)
    
    ---
    ## Real Politics from History
    
    > Adherence to f acts and struggles for objectivity do not promote racial justice. Neither do we undo racism by simply reasserting lost histories; nor do we undo racism by merely acknowledging our positionality. Our self-consciousness as we unlearn the privileges of our disciplines, however, can serve us as we struggle to rhetoricize histories and historicize rhetorics that have justice and equality as consequences.
