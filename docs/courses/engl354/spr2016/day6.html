    ## Discussion Leader (Bekah)
    
    > In the study of rhetoric as in the study of imaginative literature, scholars now realize that these supposedly inevitable textual monuments to an unbroken and progressively more sophisticated discipline are in fact quarried from among the masses of material each era produces by traditions...in how to study rhetoric. (110)
    >
    >I will here abandon my metaphor of architectural "monuments" being erected, refurbished or demolished, and adopt instead the image of a stock market report, because I need a metaphor reflecting the volatility of the tradition as it appears in our time. (111)
    
    Do you think the "blue chips" and market metaphor are effective in supporting her claims (why or why not)? What is a similar metaphor that captures Bizzell's sentiment?

    ## Discussion Leader (Katie)
    
    As cultures change and more history is uncovered or rediscovered, what are the merits and disadvantages of re-examining the "traditional" texts? What criteria would a non traditional rhetor need to meet to become a credible, teachable, addition to the rhetorical tradition?

    ## Bizzell's Historiography
    
    > It is important to remember that what we inherit as the "rhetorical tradition," for blessing or curse, comprises at least three modalities: texts deemed worthy of rhetorical study, methods of analyzing those texts, and methods of teaching rhetoric according to precepts and principles derived from those texts. Such a description of our cultural legacy would seem to put texts at the center of the tradition, and indeed, anthologies focus our attention on the rhetorical tradition as a set of texts. **(109)**

    ## Legacy of the Canon
    
    > Although the tradition appears to be text-based, how we wish to analyze verbal productions and how we prefer to teach the art of producing them govern our choices of rhetorical texts to preserve, elevate, or delete. And modern histories of rhetoric have shown that the preferences governing these choices arise out of complex cultural factors relating to gender, race, social class, national identity, and more. **(Bizzell 110)**

    ## Canon Formation
    
    * **Textual Choice** is Determined By:
    	* Gender
    	* Race
    	* Social Class
    	* National Identity
    	* etc
    ---
    ## Why We Need This
    
    > Once upon a time, these choices were dominated by the preferences of socially privileged men who saw Western culture as the best in the world, and that culture itself as springing primarily from Greek and Roman roots. As Walter Ong (1981) has explained in *Fighting for Life*, these men believed that education in rhetoric must be for men only and that boys must be introduced to it via agonistic competition. From these assumptions sprang buttresses for what we might call the "traditional tradition" in the study of rhetoric, a progression of texts written by Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Augustine, Erasmus, Bacon, Blair, and so on. This kind of study of rhetoric required extensive education, first, in Latin and Greek, often inculcated with the aid of corporal punishment, as Ong describes, and it persisted well into the twentieth century (though, one trusts, with much less flogging that went out with co-education, as Ong explains). **(Bizzell 110)**

    ## Contemporary Needs Drive Canon
    
    > Therefore, they received little attention until recent revaluations moved them more into the mainstream of the acknowledged rhetorical tradition. The best examples of this category are the Sophists; indeed, interest in them continues to burgeon, and we increased our coverage of the Sophists in our second edition. Perhaps this interest arises in part from their chronological and cultural proximity to the traditional ancient Greek "blue chips," but I think it must also be attributed in part to the Sophists' focus on the human element in knowledge-making, which has loomed increasingly large to intellectual historians and theorists in many disciplines engulfed in the present rhetorical turn. **(Bizzell 112)**

    ## Stated More Simply
    
    > the texts taken to be central to the rhetorical tradition achieve their eminence because they can be made to serve the cultural preferences of those in power. **(Bizzell 113)**

    ## New Traditions
    
    > Scholars with some different cultural assumptions and interests than those of privileged white men had to gain access to the textual record of human civilization, looking it over for texts that could be adapted to these different scholars' agenda. **(Bizzell 114)**

    > We included no texts in which the authors merely demonstrated rhetoric, but only texts in which they talked about language use in these metacritical ways. In other words, we chose writers who were all, in some sense, theorists of rhetoric. **(Bizzell 115)**
    ---
    
    ## Authority 
    
    > Nevertheless, my questioner's students did not perceive the metacritical dimensions of these texts. Apparently, they were willing to consider as rhetorical theory only texts that looked like philosophy, that is, texts that discussed rhetoric in terms of abstract principles. It is extremely revealing that my questioner mentioned Cicero's works as examples of the kind of texts that met these students' expectations. In fact, the texts traditionally regarded as the principal places in which Cicero expounds his rhetorical theory are not abstract treatises; they are highly dramatized dialogues, in respectful imitation of Plato, in which a numerous cast of characters sit around drinking under the shady trees on a country estate and conversing quite discursively about rhetoric, philosophy, and public life. But because we have the benefit of generations of scholarship and pedagogy assisting us to read these texts as rhetorical theory, we do not notice their syncretic nature. The heterodox genre issue arises only in the case of the authors newly added to the tradition, whose work does not (yet?) have the authority of Cicero's. **(Bizzell 116)**

    ## *Kairos* and Antifoundationalism
    
    > His corresponding rhetorical methodology works to seize the opportune moment (*kairos*) in which certain kinds of language can unite these disparate subjective consciousnesses into a single desire for action. Gorgias' rhetorical methodology, based on *kairos*, requires a relativistic epistemology which allows for the determination of truth through the consensus of many. *Kairos* cannot function as the basis of a rhetorical methodology within a foundational epistemology, since any time is the "right time" when one possesses truth. In the *Gorgias*, however, Plato misrepresents the Leontinian sophist as having a foundational epistemology, while retaining Gorgias' kairos-governed methodology, making him appear contradictory and absurd **(McComiskey 205-6)**
    
    ---
    
    ## Gorgias's "Beliefs"
    
    > However, as we have already seen, Gorgias the sophist rejects the notion of absolute knowledge of right and wrong in favor of belief and opinion governed by the historical moment; thus his rhetorical methodology must rely on some force other than knowledge, since knowledge is not humanly attainable. Gorgias' *technê* for moving audiences to action is aesthetic, relying on sensory *terpsis* (aesthetic pleasure) for its dominant effect. Gorgianic rhetoric is a two-step process: (1) *terpsis*, or the eliciting of a passive, aesthetic, sensory-based response to a stimulus, in this case the metron (or formal aspect) of the *logos*, leads to and must precede (2) *anankê*, or the active, *psychê*-based force that motivates the desired physical action in the audience. **(McComiskey 211)**</textarea>
