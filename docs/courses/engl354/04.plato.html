    ## Setting
    
    > CALLICLES: To join in a fight or a fray, as the saying is, Socrates, you have chosen your time well enough.
    >
    > SOCRATES: Do you mean, according to the proverb, we have come too late for a feast?
    >
    > CALLICLES: Yes, a most elegant feast; for Gorgias gave us a fine and varied display but a moment ago. 
    >
    > …
    >
    > CALLICLES: What, Chaerephon? Has Socrates a desire to hear Gorgias?
    >
    > CHAEREPHON: Yes, it is for that very purpose we are here.
    >
    > CALLICLES: Then whenever you have a mind to pay me a call—Gorgias is staying with me, and he will give you a display. (447a-b)

    ## Dialogue vs Speech
    
    
    > SOCRATES: Thank you, Callicles: but would he consent to discuss with us? For I want to find out from the man what is the function of his art, and what it is that he professes and teaches. As for the rest of his performance, he must give it us, as you suggest, on another occasion. (447b-c)
    ---
    class: big
    ## "Satisfy You"
    
    > POLUS: Yes, to be sure; and, if you like, Chaerephon, of me. For I think Gorgias must be quite tired out, after the long discourse he has just delivered.
    >
    > CHAEREPHON: Why, Polus, do you suppose you could answer more excellently than Gorgias?
    >
    > POLUS: And what does that matter, if I should satisfy you? (448a-b)
    
    ---
    ## Talking of Nothing
    
    > CHAEREPHON: But as it is, we would like to know in what art he is skilled, and hence by what name we should rightly call him.
    >
    > POLUS: Chaerephon, there are many arts amongst mankind that have been discovered experimentally, as the result of experiences: for experience conducts the course of our life according to art, but inexperience according to chance. Of these several arts various men partake in various ways, and the best men of the best. Gorgias here is one of these, and he is a partner in the finest art of all.
    >
    > SOCRATES: Fine, at any rate, Gorgias, is the equipment for discourse that Polus seems to have got: but still he is not performing his promise to Chaerephon. (448c-d)
    ---
    ## Different Languages
    
    > GORGIAS: Well, will you please ask him?
    >
    > SOCRATES: No, if you yourself will be so good as to answer, why, I would far rather ask you. For I see plainly, from what he has said, that Polus has had more practice in what is called rhetoric than in discussion.
    >
    > POLUS: How so, Socrates?
    >
    > SOCRATES: Because, Polus, when Chaerephon has asked in what art Gorgias is skilled, you merely eulogize his art as though it were under some censure, instead of replying what it is. (448d-e)
    ---
    ## Disciplines Are Their Content?
    
    > SOCRATES: Since rhetoric is in fact one of these arts which depend mainly on speech, and there are likewise other arts of the same nature, try if you can tell me with what this rhetoric, which has its effect in speech, is concerned. For instance, suppose some one asked me about one or other of the arts which I was mentioning just now: Socrates, what is the art of numeration? I should tell him, as you did me a moment ago, that it is one of those which have their effect through speech. And suppose he went on to ask: With what is its speech concerned? I should say: With the odd and even numbers, and the question of how many units there are in each. And if he asked again: What art is it that you call calculation? I should say that this also is one of those which achieve their whole effect by speech. And if he proceeded to ask: With what is it concerned? I should say…that in most respects calculation is in the same case as numeration, for both are concerned with the same thing, the odd and the even; but that they differ to this extent, that calculation considers the numerical values of odd and even numbers not merely in themselves but in relation to each other. And suppose, on my saying that astronomy also achieves its whole effect by speech, he were to ask me: And the speech of astronomy, with what is it concerned? I should say: With the courses of the stars and sun and moon, and their relative speeds. (451a-c)

    ## What is the Content of Rhetoric?
    
    > SOCRATES: Then tell me what they deal with: what subject is it, of all in the world, that is dealt with by this speech employed by rhetoric?
    >
    > GORGIAS: The greatest of human affairs, Socrates, and the best.
    >
    > SOCRATES: But that also, Gorgias, is ambiguous, and still by no means clear.  (451d-e)
    ---
    ## What is Rhetoric About?
    
    > SOCRATES: Then listen, Gorgias: I, let me assure you, [453b] for so I persuade myself—if ever there was a man who debated with another from a desire of knowing the truth of the subject discussed, I am such a man; and so, I trust, are you.
    >
    > GORGIAS: Well, what then, Socrates?
    >
    > SOCRATES: I will now tell you. What the real nature of the persuasion is that you speak of as resulting from rhetoric, and what the matters are with which persuasion deals, I assure you I do not clearly understand; though I may have my suspicions as to what I suppose you to mean by it, and with what things you think it deals. But nevertheless I will ask you what you do mean by the persuasion that results from rhetoric, and with what matters you think it deals.  (453b-c)
    
    ---
    ## Doing vs Learning
    
    > SOCRATES: Come then, tell me now about rhetoric: do you think rhetoric alone effects persuasion, or can other arts do it as well? I mean, for example, when a man teaches anything, does he persuade in his teaching? Or do you think not?
    >
    > GORGIAS: No, to be sure, Socrates, I think he most certainly does persuade. [453e]
    >
    > SOCRATES: Then let us repeat our question with reference to the same arts that we spoke of just now: does not numeration, or the person skilled in numeration, teach us all that pertains to number?
    >
    > GORGIAS: Certainly.
    >
    > SOCRATES: And persuades also?
    >
    > GORGIAS: Yes.
    >
    > SOCRATES: So that numeration also is a producer of persuasion? (453d-e)
    ---
    ## Method
    
    > GORGIAS: Well then, I mean that kind of persuasion, Socrates, which you find in the law-courts and in any public gatherings, as in fact I said just now; and it deals with what is just and unjust.
    >
    > SOCRATES: I, too, I may tell you, had a suspicion that it was this persuasion that you meant, and as dealing with those things, Gorgias; but you must not be surprised if I ask you by-and-by some such question as may seem to be obvious, though I persist in it; for, as I say, I ask my questions with a view to an orderly completion of our argument—I am not aiming at you, but only anxious that we do not fall into a habit of snatching at each other's words with a hasty guess, and that you may complete your own statement in your own way, as the premises may allow.
