> But once all this was done, unintermediated thought,or at least what seemed like unintermediated thought, was both possible and democratizable. And this unselfconscious transparency has become a stylistic, one might almost say a cultural, ideal for Western civilization. The best style is the style not noticed; the best manners,the most unobtrusive; convincing behavior spontaneous and unselfconscious. (266)

class: middle, big

## decorum, n.

**1.** That which is proper, suitable, seemly, befitting, becoming; fitness, propriety, congruity.

**†a.** esp. in dramatic, literary, or artistic composition: That which is proper to a personage, place, time, or subject in question, or to the nature, unity, or harmony of the composition; fitness, congruity, keeping. Obs.

> The classical notion of decorum, like modern equivalents—"clarity," "authenticity," and so on—measures an effect on the beholder. IF a style works, if it creates the transparent illusion, it is decorous. Decorum is such a poor descriptive term precisely because it describes so many different kinds of verbal patterns yet allows only one virtue, unselfconscious transparency. (276)

.topic[Textual Clarity]

class: middle

> Pixeled print calls this basic stylistic decorum, and the social ideal built upon it, into question. Electronic typography is both creator-controlled and reader-controlled. The screen upon which these words appear as I write has five sizes of a dozen Roman type styles and two Greek styles at its immediate command and literally hundreds more in second-level storage. I can enlarge the print if my eyes get tired, reduce it to check format and page layout, flow it around illustration if I want. I can redesign the very shapes of the letters, zoom in on them until their transparency becomes an abstract pattern of separate pixels.I can alter the whole alphabetic/graphic ratio of conventional literacy in dozens of ways. I can reverse the basic black/white, figure/ground relationship. I can create and maintain a purely transparent verbal surface, **but I need not**. (266-267)

class: middle

> The textual surface is now a malleable and self-conscious one. All kinds of production decisions have now become authorial ones. The textual surface has become permanently bistable. We are always looking first AT it and then THROUGH it, and this oscillation creates a different implied ideal of decorum, both stylistic and behavioral. Look THROUGH a text and you are in the familiar world of the Newtonian Interlude, where facts were facts,the world just "out there," folks sincere central selves, and the best writing style dropped from the writer as "simply and directly as a stone falls to the ground," just as Thoreau counseled. Look AT a text, however,and we have deconstructed the Newtonian world into Pirandello's and yearn to "act naturally." We have always had ways of triggering this oscillation, but the old ways-printing prose consecutively and verse not,layering figures of sound and arrangement on the stylistic surface until it squeaked-were clumsy, slow, unchangeable, and above all author-controlled. (267)

.topic[Bistable Decorum]

---

class: middle, big

> We have become, we might parenthetically remark, more self-conscious about prose itself. So used are we to thinking black-and-white, continuous printed prose the norm of conceptual utterance, that it has taken a series of theoretical attacks and technological metamorphoses to make us see it for what it is: an act of extraordinary stylization, of remarkable expressive self-denial. (271)

.topic[Bistable Decorum]

class: middle, big

> What will emerge finally, I think, is a new rhetoric of the arts, an unblushing and unfiltered attempt to plot all the ranges of formal expressivity now possible, however realized and created by whom- (or what-) ever. This rhetoric will make no invidious distinctions between high and low culture, commercial and pure usage, talented or chance creation, visual or auditory stimulus, iconic or alphabetic information. (276)

> How would feel about *Paradise Lost* when presented to you in a codex book? Probably you'd prefer to access it from the CD-ROM disk which, in a few years, will contain all the texts you were asked to read—or ever could read—in your undergraduate career. Wouldn't you begin to play games with it? A weapon in your hands after 2500 years of pompous pedantry about the Great Books, and you not to use it? (269)

> We will have to think about canonical expansion from a technological as well as a theoretical perspective. If nowadays students read only what they are assigned,soon they can be assigned almost anything they should read-and will have their own copy of it. In university literature courses,we will soon have to teach students who have been brought up on interactive electronic "texts," and we willhave to prepare them for a world of work which relies on the electronic word. I don't think we can sit out this technological revolution; why not use it? (272-273)

> In the digital light of these new technologies, the disciplinary boundaries that currently govern academic study of the arts dissolve before our eyes, as do the administrative structures which enshrine them. It is not only the distinction between the creator and the critic which dissolves, but the walls between painting and music and sculpture and architecture and literature. (275)

> And because all arts face the same technological pressures, they are going to find, create, new relationships through that technology, through their new digital equivalences. Such equivalences pose the most fundamental, and most obvious, challenges to the structure and purpose of the university arts curriculum, and to the place of literary study in it. The shocked responses to chance techniques of creation in experimental music will no doubt be duplicated in responses to programs which create **aleatory poetry**. (275)

> The chain reaction goes critical. The difference is profound. You change Edens. And your new Eden becomes, not choosing one or the other attitudinal world, as the current deconstructionist streetfight trivializes it, but determining what kind of oscillation between them you want to create and what stylistic patterns will create it.You return, by electronic ambages to that Renaissance *sprezzatura* of rehearsed spontaneity which Newtonian science so unceremoniously set aside. (267-268)

.topic[How is this Rhetoric?]

class: middle, big

> For bistable decorum is not only the premise of electronic text, it has been the fundamental premise of rhetorical education from the Greeks onward. We can thus use this electronic decorum to rewrite the history and criticism of Western literature wherever it has been influenced by rhetoric—and that is practically everywhere. Rhetoric becomes, through the digital equivalences such a matrix can plot, a general theory for all the arts. And thus the central structure for a central curriculum in the arts and letters. (278)

.topic[How is this Rhetoric?]

class: middle

> Pixeled print *destabilizes* the arts and letters in an essentially rhetorical way,returns them to that characteristic oscillation between looking AT symbols and looking THROUGH them which the rhetorical paideia instilled as a native address to the world. Our present squabble in the public prints about teaching Western culture is usually animated on both sides by a radical misapprehension about what "Western Culture" has always been. We are asked to believe that it has been a print-stable collection of Great Ideas enshrined in Great Books, and we now quarrel about which books are, for our present needs, really Great. But Western education has in its essence been rhetorical, has been based, that is,not on a set of great ideas,but on a manner of apprehension; it has taught as central not knowledge but how knowledge is held.
