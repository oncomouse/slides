# J.L. Austin, from *How To Do Things With Words*

class: f27px
## Performative

> (E. _a_) 'I do (sc. take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife)'-as uttered in the course of the marriage ceremony.  
> (E. _b_) 'I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth'-as uttered when smashing the bottle against the stem.
>
>...
>
> In these examples it seems clear that to utter the sentence (in, of course, the appropriate circumstances) is not to describe my doing of what I should be said in so uttering to be doing or to state that I am doing it: it is to do it. None of the utterances cited is either true or false... (6)

## Danger

> Are we then to say things like this:  
> "To marry is to say a few words", or  
> "Betting is simply saying something"?  
>…  
> But probably the real reason why such remarks sound dangerous lies in another obvious fact, to which we shall have to revert in detail later, which is this. The uttering of the words is, indeed, usually a, or even _the_, leading incident in the performance of the act (of betting or what not), the performance of which is also the object of the utterance, but it is far from being usually, even if it is ever, the sole thing necessary if the act is to be deemed to have been performed. Speaking generally, it is always necessary that the circumstances in which the words are uttered should be in some way, or ways, appropriate, and it is very commonly necessary that either the speaker himself or other persons should also perform certain other actions, whether physical' or “mental' actions or even acts of uttering further words. (7-8)

## Signal Inner Change

> The action may be performed in ways other than by a performative utterance, and in any case the circumstances, including other actions, must be appropriate. But we may, in objecting, have something totally different, and this time quite mistaken, in mind, especially when we think of some of the more awe-inspiring performatives such as 'I promise to...'. Surely the words must be spoken 'seriously' and so as to be taken 'seriously? This is, though vague, true enough in general-it is an important commonplace in discussing the purport of any utterance whatsoever. I must not be joking, for example, nor writing a poem. But we are apt to have a feeling that their being serious consists in their being uttered as (merely) the outward and visible sign, for convenience or other record or for information, of an inward and spiritual act: from which it is but a short step to go on to believe or to assume without realizing that for many purposes the outward utterance is a description, _true_ or _false_, of the occurrence of the inward performance. (9)

## Beyond True and False

> If we exclude such fictitious inward acts as this, can we suppose that any of the other things which certainly are normally required to accompany an utterance such as 'I promise that ...' or 'I do (take this woman ...)' are in fact described by it, and consequently do by their presence make it true or by their absence make it false? Well, taking the latter first, we shall next consider what we actually do say about the utterance concerned when one or another of its normal concomitants is absent. In no case do we say that the utterance was false but rather that the utterance—or rather the act, e.g. the promise—was void, or given in bad faith, or not implemented, or the like. (10-11)

## Context Matters → Infelicities

> Let us first at least concentrate attention on the little matter already mentioned in passing-this matter of "the appropriate circumstances. To bet is not, as I pointed out in passing, merely to utter the words 'I bet, &c.': someone might do that all right, and yet we might still not agree that he had in fact, or at least entirely, succeeded in betting. To satisfy ourselves of this, we have only, for example, to announce our bet after the race is over. Besides the uttering of the words of the so-called performative, a good many other things have as a general rule to be right and to go right if we are to be said to have happily brought off our action. What these are we may hope to discover by looking at and classifying types of case in which something *goes wrong* and the act—marrying, betting, bequeathing, christening, or what not—is therefore at least to some extent a failure: the utterance is then, we may say, not indeed false but in general unhappy. And for this reason we call the doctrine of the *things that can be and go wrong* on the occasion of such utterances, the doctrine of the *Infelicities*. (13-14)

class: f21px
## Lying

> Lastly we may ask-and here I must let some of my cats on the table-does the notion of infelicity apply to utterances *which are statements*? So far we have produced the infelicity as characteristic of the *performative* utterance, which was 'defined' (if we can call it so much) mainly by contrast with the supposedly familiar 'statement'. Yet I will content myself here with pointing out that one of the things that has been happening lately in philosophy is that close attention has been given even to 'statements' which, though not false exactly nor yet "contradictory, are yet outrageous. For instance, statements which refer to something which does not exist as, for example, "The present King of France is bald'. There might be a temptation to assimilate this to purporting to bequeath something which you do not own. Is there not a presupposition of existence in each? Is not a statement which refers to something which does not exist not so much false as void? And the more we consider a statement not as a sentence (or proposition) but as an act of speech (out of which the others are logical constructions) the more we are studying the whole thing as an act. Or again, there are obvious similarities between a lie and a false promise.

## To Say Is To Do

> ...it therefore seemed expedient to go farther back for a while to fundamentals-to consider from the ground up how many senses there are in which to say something is to do something, or in saying something we do something, and even by saying something we do something. And we began by distinguishing a whole group of senses of 'doing something' which are all included together when we say, what is obvious, that to say something is in the full normal sense to do something-which includes the utterance of certain noises, the utterance of certain words in a certain construction, and the utterance of them with a certain 'meaning' in the favourite philosophical sense of that word, i.e. with a certain sense and with a certain reference.
>
> The act of 'saying something' in this full normal sense I call, i.e. dub, the performance of a locutionary act, and the study of utterances thus far and in these respects the study of locutions, or of the full units of speech. (94)
---
class: f25px
## Illocutionary acts

> It makes a great difference whether we were advising, or merely suggesting, or actually ordering, whether we were strictly promising or only announcing a vague intention, and so forth. These issues penetrate a little but not without confusion into grammar (see above), but we constantly do debate them, in such terms as whether certain words (a certain locution) had the force of a question, or ought to have been taken as an estimate and so on.
I explained the performance of an act in this new and second sense as the performance of an 'illocutionary' act, i.e. performance of an act *in* saying something as opposed to performance of an act *of* saying something; I call the act performed an 'illocution' and shall refer to the doctrine of the different types of function of language here in question as the doctrine of 'illocutionary forces'. (99-100)

## The Three Speech acts

1. **Locution**—Utterance and meaning, description
  * "He said to me 'Shoot her!' meaning by 'shoot' shoot and referring by 'her' to her."
1. **Illocution**—The intended effect of the utterance
  * "He urged (or advised, ordered, &c.) me to shoot her."
1. **Perlocution**—The actual effect of the utterance
  * "He persuaded me to shoot her."
  * "He got me to (or made me, &c.) shoot her."

## Attempting to vs Doing

> Acts of all our three kinds necessitate, since they are the performing of actions, allowance being made for the ills that all action is heir to. We must systematically be prepared to distinguish between "the act of doing ', i.e. achieving x, and “the act of attempting to do a'.
>
>In the case of illocutions we must be ready to draw the necessary distinction, not noticed by ordinary language except in exceptional cases, between
>
>(a) the act of attempting or purporting (or affecting or professing or claiming or setting up or setting out) to perform a certain illocutionary act, and
> (b) the act of successfully achieving or consummating or bringing off such an act. (105-6)
---
class: f29px
## Success and Failure

> Since our acts are actions, we must always remember the distinction between producing effects or consequences which are intended or unintended; and (i) when the speaker intends to produce an effect it may nevertheless not occur, and (ii) when he does not intend to produce it or intends not to produce it it may nevertheless occur. To cope with complication (i) we invoke as before the distinction between attempt and achievement; to cope with complication (ii) we invoke the normal linguistic devices of disclaiming (adverbs like 'unintentionally' and so on) which we hold ready for general use in all cases of doing actions.
