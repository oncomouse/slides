## Two Questions To Ask About Sources

1. Does this source make an argument?
1. Does this source increase my ethos?

**Bitzer, Lloyd F. “The Rhetorical Situation.” *Philosophy & Rhetoric* 1.1 (1968): 1–14. Print.**  
<br>Bitzer outlines a scheme for understanding rhetoric as a response to a particular historical situation. He identifies three elements of these situations: exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the particular issue needing to be solved through speaking, audience is the group of people to be moved to action, and constraints are the cultural factors that limit what the rhetor can say. Bitzer's account provides a model for doing rhetorical analysis of great speeches that focuses on the historical scene rather than the text itself.

**Bitzer, Lloyd F. “The Rhetorical Situation.” *Philosophy & Rhetoric* 1.1 (1968): 1–14. Print.**  
<br>Bitzer represents a fascinating response to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. To make sense of the trauma felt by the nation after seeing a beloved president murdered on television, Bitzer invents a new theory of rhetoric in which historic events call out to be spoken about. In times of crisis, Bitzer argues, rhetors come forward to provide direction to the nation and address exigences that exist in the world, through a need perceived in the flow of historical events.

**Bitzer, Lloyd F. “The Rhetorical Situation.” *Philosophy & Rhetoric* 1.1 (1968): 1–14. Print.**  
<br>Bitzer represents the limits of canonical thinking. His scheme for the rhetorical situation highlights that rhetoric is primarily a kairotic moment in response to a particular exigence: history calls us to speak. At the same time, however, he goes on to suggest that certain situations persist through time and that, therefore, the speak they called into existence continues to speak to us. While Bitzer's framework for historical situating rhetoric in context is useful, his insistence that great speeches persist because of an inherent greatness (or because the greatness of the situation persists) continues to argue for a particularly canon of "important" rhetorical texts.
