    # Jacques Ellul, From *Propaganda*
    ---
    class: f25px
    ## Science?
    
    > True modern propaganda can only function within the context of the modem scientific system. But what is it? Many observers loot upon propaganda a* a coilection of "gimmicks" and of more ur less serious practice1 And psychologists and sociologists very often reject the scientific character of these practices. For our part, we completely agree that propaganda is a technique rather than a science. But it is a *modern* technique—that is it is based on one or more branches of science. Propaganda is the expression of these branches of science; it moves with them, shares in their successes and bears witness to their failures. The time is past when propaganda was a matter of individual inspiration, personal subtlety or the use of unsophisticated tricks. Now science has entered propaganda, as we shall reveal from four different points of view. (3-4)

    ## Four Science Points
    
    > First of all, modern propaganda is based on scientific analyses of psychology and sociology…
    >
    > Second, propaganda is scientific in that it tends to establish a set of rules, rigorous, precise, and tested, that are not merely recipes but impose themselves on every propagandist, who is less and less free to follow his own impulses…
    >
    > Third, what Is needed nowadays is an exact analysis of both the environment and the individual to be subjected to propaganda…
    >
    > Finally, one last trait reveals the scientific character of modem propaganda: the increasing attempt to control its use, measure its results, define its effects…
    >
    > It indicates that propaganda is no longer a self-contained action, covering up for evil deeds. It is an object of serious thought, and proceeds along scientific channels. (4-5)

    ## Individual and Mass
    
    > Any modern propaganda will, first of all, address itself at one and the same time to the individual and to the mosses, ft cannot separate the two elements. For propaganda to address itself to the individual, in his isolation, apart from the crowd, is impossible. The individual is of no interest to the propagandist; as an isolated unit he presents much too much resistance to external action To be effective, propaganda cannot be concerned with detail, not only because to win men over one by one takes much too long, but abo because to create certain convictions in an isolated individual is much too difficult. Propaganda ceases where simple dialogue begins…Modem propaganda reaches individuals enclosed in the mass and as participants in that mass, yet it also aims at a crowd, but only as a body composed of individuals. (6)

    ## Lonely Crowd of Modernity
    
    > He therefore feels himself individually concerned as a person, as a participant. The movie spectator also is alone, though elbow to elbow with his neighbors, he still is, because of the darkness and the hypnotic attraction of the screen, perfectly alone. This is the situation of the "lonely crowd," or of isolation in the mass, which is a natural product of present-day society and which is both used and deepened by the mass media. The most favorable moment to seize a man and influence him is when he is alone in the mass: it is at this point that propaganda can be meat effective.
    >
    >We must emphasize this circle which we shall meet again and again; the structure of present-day society places the individual where he is most easily reached by propaganda. (8-9)

    ## Propaganda is Multimodal
    
    > Propaganda must be total- The propagandist must utilize all of the technical means at his disposal—the press, radio, TV, movies, posters, meetings, door-to-door canvassing. Modern propaganda must utilize *all* of these media. There is no propaganda is long as one makes use, in sporadic fashion and at random, of a newspaper article here, a poster or a radio program there, organizes a few meetings and lectures, writes a few slogans on walls; that is not propaganda. Each usable medium has its own particular way of penetration—specific, but at the same time localized and limited; by itself it cannot attack the individual, break down his resistance, make his decisions for him…A word spoken on the radio is not the same, does not produce the same effect, does not have the same impact as the identical word spoken in private conversation or in a public speech before a large crowd. To draw the individual Into the net of propaganda, each technique must be utilized in its own specific way, directed toward producing the effect it can best produce, and used with all the other media, each of them reaching the individual in a specific fashion and making him react anew to the same theme (9-10)

    ## Myth
    
    > Through the myth it creates, propaganda imposes a complete range of intuitive knowledge, susceptible of only one interpretation unique and one-sided, and precluding any divergence. This myth becomes so powerful that it invades every area of consciousness, leaving no faculty or motivation intact, it stimulates in the individual a feeling of exclusiveness and produces a biased attitude. This myth has such motive force that, once accepted, it controls the whole of the individual, who becomes immune to any other influence. This explains the totalitarian attitude that the individual adopts—wherever a myth has been successfully created —and that simply reflects the totalitarian action of propaganda on him.
    >
    > Not only does propaganda seek to invade the whole man, to lead him to adopt a mystical attitude and reach him through all possible psychological channels, but, more, it speaks to all men. (11)

    ## Duration of Propaganda
    
    > Propaganda is not a stimulus that disappears quickly; it consists of successive impulses and shocks aimed at various feelings or thoughts by means of the many instruments previously mentioned. A relay system is thus established. Propaganda is a continuous action, without failure or interruption: as soon as the effect of one impulse is weakened, it is renewed by another. At no point does it fail to subject its recipient to its influence. As soon as one effect wears off, it is followed by a new shock.
    >
    > Continuous propaganda exceeds the individual's capacities for attention or adaptation and thus his capabilities of resistance. This trait of continuity explains why propaganda can indulge in sudden twists and turns. (18)
    ---
    class: f26px
    ## Elections and Duration
    
    > The steadiness of the propaganda prevails over his sporadic attention and makes him follow all the turns from the time he has begun to eat of this bread.
    >
    > That is why one cannot really speak of propaganda in connection with an election campaign that lasts only two weeks. At such a time, some intellectual always will show that election propaganda is ineffectual; that its gross methods, its inscriptions on walls, can convince nobody; that opposing arguments neutralize each other. And it is true that the population is often indifferent to election propaganda. But it is not surprising that such propaganda has little effect: none of the great techniques- of propaganda can be effective in two weeks. (19)

    ## Continuous Agitation
    
    > What is needed, then, is continuous agitation produced artificially even when nothing in the events of the day justifies or arouses excitement. Therefore, continuing, propaganda must slowly create a climate first, and then prevent the individual from noticing a particular propaganda operation in contrast to ordinary daily events. (20)
    ---
    class: f24px
    ## Organization
    
    > To begin with propaganda must be organized in several ways. To give it the above-mentioned characteristics (continuity, duration, combination of different media), an organization is required thai controls the mass media, is capable of using them correctly, of calculating the effect of one or another slogan or of replacing one campaign with another. There must be an *administrative* organization; every modern state is expected to have a Ministry of Propaganda, whatever its actual name may be- just as technicians are needed to make films and radio broadcasts, so one needs "technicians of influence"—sociologists and psychologists. But this indispensable administrative organization is not what we are speaking of here. What we mean is that propaganda is always institutionalized to the extent of the existence of an "*Apparat*" in the German sense of the term—a machine. (20)

    ## Propaganda and Rhetoric
    
    > It is too often believed that propaganda serves the purpose of sugar-coating bitter pills, of making people accept policies they would not accept spontaneously. But in most cases propaganda seeks to point out courses of action desirable in themselves, such as helpful reforms. Propaganda then becomes this mixture of the actual satisfaction given to the people by the reforms and subsequent exploitation of that satisfaction. (21)
    ---
    class: f26px
    ## Propaganda and Action
    
    > It calls on all the psychological mechanisms, hut appeals to reason as well. It tries to convince, to bring about a decision, to create a firm adherence to some truth- Then, obviously, If the conviction is sufficiently strong, after some soul searching, the individual is ready for action.
    >
    > This line of reasoning is completely wrong- To view propaganda as still being what it was in 1850 is to cling to an obsolete concept of man and of the means to influence him; it is to condemn oneself to understand nothing about modern propaganda- The aim of modem propaganda is no longer to modify ideas, but to provoke action. (25) 
    ---
    class: f23px
    ## Orthopraxy
    
    > Such an action cannot be obtained by the process of choice and deliberation. To be effective, propaganda must constantly short- circuit all thought and decision. It must operate on the individual at the level of the unconscious. He must not know that he is being shaped by outside forces (this is one of the conditions for the success of propaganda), but some central core in him must be reached in order to release the mechanism in the unconscious which will provide the appropriate—and expected —action.
    >
    > We have just said that action exactly suited to its ends must be obtained. This leads us to state that if the classic but out- moded view of propaganda consists in defining it as an adherence of man to an *orthodoxy*, true modem propaganda seeks, on the contrary, to obtain an *orthopraxy*—an action that in itself, and not because of the value judgments of the person who is acting, leads directly to a goal…(27)

    class: f31px
    ## Myth and Action
    
    > On the other hand, the propagandist tries to create myths by which man will live, which respond to his sense of the sacred. By "myth" we mean an all-encompassing, activating image: a sort of vision of desirable objectives that have lost their material, practical character and have become strongly colored, overwhelming, all-encompassing, and which displace from the conscious all that is not related to it. Such an image pushes man to action precisely because it includes all that he feels is good, just, and true. (31)</textarea>
