# Edward Schiappa<br>"Neo-Sophistic Rhetorical Criticism or the Historical Reconstruction of Sophistic Doctrines?"
---
class: bigger
## Discussion Leader (Emily)

Do historians know the sources Aristotle used to write *On Rhetoric*, and are his changes consistent? Is this how historians decide author’s intent or do they use another way since most of the classical sophistic writing is lost? Do those conducting rational reconstructions avoid it because it is still widely viewed as impossible to uncover?

## Discussion Leader (Drew)

As implied by Dr. Poulakos and Schiappa, is it more appropriate for cultural historians to take up the study of the Sophists, or is Sophistic study something that belongs solely to rhetoric scholars?

## Historical Facts

> There is an important difference between a) appreciating sophistic thinking as contributing to contemporary rhetorical theory and criticism, and b) reconstructing specific sophistic theories or doctrines of rhetoric. While both activities involve interpretation, they differ in that the former involves modem application and extension of sophistic thinking, while the latter deliberates over matters of historical fact. (193)

## Historical Reconstruction vs Rational Reconstruction

> Rational and historical reconstruction differ in terms of *goals* and *methods*. Since the goal of historical reconstruction is to recapture the past insofar as possible on its own terms, the methods of the historian and, in classical work, the philologist, are appropriate. Since the goal of rational reconstruction is to provide criticai insight to contemporary theorists, the needs and values of current audiences justify less rigidity and more creativity in the process of interesting how dead authors through their texts speak to live, contemporary audiences. (194)

---

## For Us?

> If the notion of history for history's sake leaves one cold, an instrumental rationale for careful historical reconstruction is identifiable as well. If the purpose for doing history is to enlighten our understanding of the present, then there is a better chance for enrichment if we treat the past seriously: "Thought is the prisoner of whatever place it is to be found [if] it cannot break the bonds of the present" (Bloom, 1955, p. 233). It is just those historical problems that appear to be the least interesting from a contemporary perspective that can be the most revealing "because they contain the elements which were peculiar to an age and no longer inspire curiosity in later ages" (Bloom, 1955, p. 233). Before we can "use" history, we must first adequately understand it. (196)

## New Historicism

> Otherwise "historical" accounts tend to become self-affirming discoveries of early anticipations of voguish philosophical theories. There has been a tendency, especially prevalent in the case of the Sophists, to enhance the prestige of current theoretical pieties by linking them to ancient Greek roots. (196)

---

## Is Naming Inventing?

> A further justification for renewed historical reconstruction of sophistic theories of discourse is the fact that the Greek word for rhetoric—*ῥητορική (rhetorike)*—was not coined until the early fourth Century b.c.. Accordingly, any historical claim concerning how "rhetoric" was defined or theorized about during the fifth Century b.c. (the era of the Older Sophists) must be considered suspect if the claim presumes rhetoric was dearly recognized as a conceptualized, discrete verbal art with a body of identifiable teachings. 
>
> A careful assessment of fifth-century texts demonstrates two important philological facts. First, the term *rhetorike* simply cannot be found: the first usage of the term "rhetoric" to designate the teachable art of the *rhetor* appears to be by Plato around 385 b.c. Second, the term that occupies the attention of the Older Sophists most often is logos, and by no stretch of the imagination can one equate or simply substitute the term *logos* for *rhetorike*. (197)


---

## Absent Presences / Present Absences

> The objection could be made that the absence of the word *rhetorike* means little. Even without the signifier (*rhetorike*), the signified (practice of rhetoric) existed and can be meaningfully discussed today. The absence of a word for "gravity" in prehistoric time, as one critic has commented, obviously does not mean that in prehistoric time such a force did not exist. Certainly one can grant that a discursive practice now called "rhetoric" existed prior to the coining of the term *rhetorike*. While the absence of *rhetorike* in the fifth Century does not prevent us from appreciating sophistic thinking from the perspective of modem rhetorical theory (via rational reconstruction), the relatively late appearance of the term nonetheless must be dealt with in any serious historical account of early theorizing about language. As intellectual disciplines evolve, so do their conceptual vocabularies. Accordingly, any serious effort to historically reconstruct the development of Greek rhetorical *theory* must reckon with the late coining of the Greek word *rhetorike*. (197-8)

---

## The Burden of History

> If the Sophists' discourse seems highly stylized to the modern reader (or even to those reading it in the more literate fourth Century) it is because predominantly orai modes of thinking and speaking are foreign to us. As Connors points out, there is a direct correspondent between the rise of literacy and the decline of the "grand style" of the Older Sophists. The change in "style" has less to do with "aesthetics" than it has to do with changing syntax, word-meanings, and modes of thinking that separate orai from literate ways of life. (202)

> In short, the Sophists' experiments in style were important but hardly unique, and they were more a part of the effects of emerging literacy and semantic self-consciousness than they were a part of a conscious theory of style per se.  (202)

---

## Doing Rhetoric vs Theorizing Rhetoric

> Perhaps it is enough praise of the Sophists' originality to say that they raised issues and sparked ideas that would later become codified into recognizable rhetorical theory. It is neither necessary nor supportable, at this point, to imply that there was an identifiable "sophistic view proper" of the art of rhetoric in the fifth Century (1983c, p. 37). As Poulakos admits, sophistic approaches to discourse "come down to us as a story, a legacy" rather than as a completed treatise or text (1983a, p. 30). It should be added that their legacy does not include an identifiable sophistic definition of rhetoric, but rather a variety of incipient theories regarding discourse. (204)

---

## Style?

> sophistic "style" was more a matter of cultural influence than a deliberate "aesthetic theory." (207)

> Such a wide assortment of "styles" is not reducible to different aesthetic preferences. The Sophists excelled in ail common forms of discourse, and each contributed to the development of new genres. Given that fifth-century Athens was in a transition between preliteracy and literacy, such a divergence in "style" is thus a sign of difference in the manner and extent to which each Sophist advanced *logos* over poetic *mythos*. For example, Protagoras, Gorgias, and Critias analyzed and possibly critiqued the epic poets, but there is no solid evidence that the other four Sophists did the same.
