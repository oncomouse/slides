## Reminder

1. Office Hours this week are from 1 until 3 on Wednesday

## Discussion Leader (Sarah)

> Technologies are artificial, but -- paradox again -- artificiality is natural to human beings. Technology, properly interiorized, does not degrade human life but on the contrary enhances it. (32)

How has the ability to read and write enhanced our ability to understand different subjects and arguments? Does reading an article or paper detract from understanding and learning the author's claims when compared to them personally speaking the same opinion?

---
## Discussion Leader (Katherine)

> given the human condition and the advantages conferred by writing, the invention of writing, and even of alphabetic writing, was sure to occur somewhere in the evolution of culture and consciousness: But to say that language is writing is, at best, uninformed. It provides egregious evidence of the unreflective chirographic and/or typographic squint that haunts us all.

Given that we know written language allows for all types of new thoughts and wealth of ideas and innovation, which oral culture does not allowed for, do you think Ong over-emphasizes the value of learning oral language without it being constantly paired with the written? Do you think it's possible to express oneself accurately in writing or is Ong correct in asserting that written language is always an imperfect representation of the oral?

## Literacy as "Normal"


> [Literacy] tends to arrogate to itself supreme power by taking itself as normative for human expression and thought. This is particularly true in high-technology cultures, which are built on literacy of necessity and which encourage the impression that literacy is an always to be expected and even natural state of affairs. The term 'illiterate' itself suggests that persons belonging to the class it designates are deviants, defined by something they lack, namely literacy. Moreover, in high-technology cultures-which, more and more, are setting the style for cultures across the world- since literacy is regarded as so unquestionably normative and nor- mal, the deviancy of illiterates tends to be thought of as lack of a simple mechanical skill. Illiterates should learn writing as they learned to tie their shoe-laces or to drive a car. Such views of writing as simply a mechanical skill obligatory for all human beings distort our understanding of what is human if only because they block understanding of what natural human mental processes are before writing takes possession of consciousness. (23)

## Secondary Orality

> Recent research work, however, in the field and in the library, is offering the opportunity to overcome our chirographic (and typographic) bias: This work has deepened our understanding of what I have styled primary orality, the orality of cultures with no knowledge at all of writing, as contrasted with what I have styled secondary orality, the electronic orality of radio and 'television, which grows out of high-literacy cultures, depending for its invention and operation on the widespread cultivation of writing and reading. (23-4)

---
## Internalize Writing

> Functionally literate persons, those who regularly assimilate discourse such as this, are not simply thinking and speaking human beings but chirographically thinking and speaking human beings (latterly conditioned also by print and by electronics). The fact that we do not commonly feel the influence of writing on our thoughts shows that we have interiorized the technology of writing so deeply that without tremendous effort we cannot separate it from our- selves or even recognize its presence and influence. If functionally literate persons are asked to think of the word 'nevertheless', they will all have present in imagination the letters of the word-vaguely perhaps, but unavoidably-in handwriting or typescript or print. If they are asked to think of the word 'nevertheless' for two minutes, 120 seconds, without ever allowing any letters at all to enter their imaginations, they cannot comply. A person from a completely oral background of course has no such problem. He or she will think only of the real word, a sequence of sounds, 'ne-ver-the-less'. For the real word 'nevertheless', the sounded word, cannot ever be present all at once, as written words deceptively seem to be. (24)

class: big
## Happening & Thing

> Sound exists only when it is going out of existence. By the time I get to the 'the-less', the 'ne-ver' is gone. To the extent that it makes all of a word appear present at once, writing falsifies. Recalling sounded words is like recalling a bar of music, a melody, a sequence in time. A word is an event, a happening, not a thing, as letters make it appear to be. (25)
---
## Oral Memory

> The mind trained in an oral culture does not feel the literate's distress: it can operate with exquisite skill in the world of sounds, events, evanescences. How does it manage? Basically, in its noetic operations it uses formulaic structures and procedures that stick in the mind to complement and counteract the evanescent: proverbs and other fixed sayings, epithets, that is, standard, expected qualifiers (the *sturdy* oak, the *brave* warrior, *wise* Nestor, *clever* Odysseus), numerical sets (the three Graces, the seven deadly sins, the five senses, and so on), balance, rhythms of all sorts ('Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven')-anything to make it easy to call back what Homer recognized were 'winged words'. (25)

## Technologizing the Word

> One weakness in Plato's position is that he put these misgivings about writing into writing, just as one weakness in antiprint positions is that their proponents put their objections into print, and one weakness in anti-computer positions is that they are articulated in articles or books printed from tapes composed on computer terminals. The law at work here is: once the word is technologized, there is no really effective way to criticize its condition without the aid of the technology you are criticizing. The complaints about these three inventions are all the same because writing and print and the computer are all ways of technologizing the word. (28)
---
## Writing as Technology

> In downgrading writing, Plato was thinking of writing as an external, alien technology, as many people today think of the computer. Because we have by today so deeply interiorized writing, made it so much a part of ourselves, as Plato's age had not yet made it fully a part of itself, we find it difficult to consider writing to be a technology as we commonly assume printing and the computer to be. Yet writing (and especially alphabetic writing) is a technology, calling for the use of tools and other equipment, styli or brushes or pens, carefully prepared surfaces such as paper, animal skins, strips of wood, as well as inks or paints, and much more. Writing tech- nologies have differed in different parts of the world. In their own indigenous technologies of writing, East Asia-China, Korea, and Japan-typically used not pens but brushes, not liquid ink in ink-horns or inkwells, but ink blocks, on which the wet brush was rubbed as in making water-colour paintings, in this sense 'painting' rather than 'writing' (etymologically, 'scratching') their texts. (30)
---
## Death and Rebirth of the Word

> Once reduced to space, words are frozen and in a sense dead. Yet there is a paradox in the fact that the deadness of the written or printed text, its removal from the living human lifeworld, its rigid visual fixity, assures its endurance and its potential for being resurrected into limitless living contexts by a limitless number of living readers. The dead, thing-like text has potentials far outdistancing those of the simply spoken word. The complementary paradox, however, is that the written text, for all its permanence, means nothing, is not even a text, except in relationship to the spoken word. For a text to be intelligible, to deliver its message, it must be reconverted into sound, directly or indirectly, either really in the external world or in the auditory imagination. All verbal expres- sion, whether put into writing, print, or the computer, is ineluctably bound to sound forever. (31)
---
## Alienating

> To say writing is artificial is not to condemn it but to praise it. Like other artificial creations and indeed more than any other, writing is utterly invaluable and indeed essential for the realization of fuller, interior, human potentials. Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word. Such transformations of consciousness can be uplifting, at the same time that they are in a sense alienating. By distancing thought, alienating it from its original habitat in sounded words, writing raises consciousness. Alienation from a natural milieu can be good for us and indeed is in many ways essential for fuller human life. To live and to understand fully, we need not only proximity but also distance. This writing provides for, thereby accelerating the evolution of consciousness as nothing else before it does. (32)
---
## Evolving Life-World

> Writing, in the ordinary sense of a coded system of visible marks enabling a writer to determine, in effect without limit, the exact words and sequence of words that a reader will generate from a given text, is the most momentous of all human technological inventions. It is not a mere appendage or accessory to oral speech. Because it moves speech drastically from the oral-aural or voice-and-ear world to a new sensory world, that of vision, writing transforms speech and thought as well. Notches on sticks and other *aides-mimoire* can lead up to writing, but they do not restructure the human lifeworld as true writing does. (35)
