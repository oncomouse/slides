# Kenneth Burke <br> "The Definition of Man"
---
class: big
## Discussion Leader (Natasha)

Does being a good rhetorician only mean that one has the ability to easily persuade people in their favor? Or, does it mean also, that rhetoricians are able to identify when rhetorical devices are being used to persuade them, in effort to resist manipulation (494). And if we move to include the latter as a defining clause when it comes to being a good rhetorician, then should we not, in our personal strives toward perfection, include lessons in identification and resistance, in our rhetorical education?

## Discussion Leader (Samantha)

.burke-poem[.center[![](../../images/burke.png)]]

Does the ending of the modernized poem suggest that man will end its own existence through desire for perfection/progress? If so, can our symbol-using system be the blame of this projected destruction, since this system ultimately causes men to strive for perfection?

## Definition

> Definitions are also the critic's equivalent of the lyric (though a poet might not think sol) in that the writer usually "hits on them." They are "break-throughs," and thus are somewhat hard to come by. We should always keep trying for them-but they don't always seem to "click." 
>
> A definition should have just enough clauses, and no more. (491)

## Five Clauses

Man is

1. the symbol-using animal
1. the inventor of the negative
1. separated from his natural condition by instruments of his own making
1. goaded by the spirit of hierarchy
1. rotten with perfection
---
## Transmission of Knowledge / Emotion

> (1) The ability to describe this method in words would have readily made it possible for all other birds to take over this same "act" of genius, though they themselves might never have hit upon it. 
>
> (2) The likelihood is that even this one wren never used the method again. For the ability to conceptualize implies a kind of attention without which this innovation could probably not advance beyond the condition of a mere accident to the condition of an invention.
>
> (3) On the happier side, there is the thought that at least, through lack of such ability, birds are spared our many susceptibilities to the ways of demagogic spellbinders. They cannot be filled with fantastic hatreds for alien populations they know about mainly by mere hearsay, or with all sorts of unsettling new expectations, most of which could not possibly turn out as promised. (493)
---
class: big
## Action / Knowledge at a Distance

> The "symbol-using animal," yes, obviously. But can we bring ourselves to realize just what that formula implies, just how overwhelmingly much of what we mean by "reality" has been built up for us through nothing but our symbol-systems? Take away our books, and what little do we know about history, biography, even something so "down to earth" as the relative position of seas and continents? What is our "reality" for today (beyond the paper-thin line of our own particular lives) but all this clutter of symbols about the past combined with whatever things we know mainly through maps, magazines, newspapers, and the like about the present? (493)
---
class: big
## Terministic Screens

> In responding to words, with their overt and covert modes of persuasion ("progress" is a typical one that usually sets expectations to vibrating), we like to forget the kind of relation that really prevails between the verbal and the non-verbal. In being a link between us and the non-verbal, words are by the same token a screen separating us from the non-verbal-though the statement gets tangled in its own traces, since so much of the "we" that is separated from the non-verbal by the verbal would not even exist were it not for the verbal (or for our symbolicity in general, since the same applies to the symbol-systems of dance, music, painting, and the like). (493-4)
---
class: big
## System of Signs w/ No Positive Terms

> Language referring to the realm of the non-verbal is necessarily talk about things in terms of what they are not-and in this sense we start out beset by a paradox. Such language is but a set of labels, signs for helping us find our way about. Indeed, they can even be so useful that they help us to invent ingenious ways of threatening to destroy ourselves. But even accuracy of this powerful sort does not get around the fact that such terms are sheer emptiness, as compared with the substance of things they name. (494)
---
class: big
## Symbolicity / Animality

> When a bit of talking takes place, just what is doing the talking? Just where are the words coming from? Some of the motivation must derive from our animality, and some from our symbolicity. We hear of "brain-washing," of schemes whereby an "ideology" is imposed upon people. But should we stop at that? Should we not also see the situation the other way around? For was not the "brainwasher" also similarly motivated? Do we simply use words, or do they not also use us? An "ideology" is like a god coming down to earth, where it will inhabit a place pervaded by its presence. An "ideology" is like a spirit taking up its abode in a body: it makes that body hop around in certain ways; and that same body would have hopped around in different ways had a different ideology happened to inhabit it. (494-5)

class: big
## The Negative and "Nature"

> To look for negatives in nature would be as absurd as though you were to go out hunting for the square root of minus-one. The negative is a function peculiar to symbol-systems, quite as the square root of minus-one is an implication of a certain mathematical symbolsystem. 
>
> The quickest way to demonstrate the sheer symbolicity of the negative is to look at any object, say, a table, and to remind yourself that, though it is exactly what it is, you could go on for the rest of your life saying all the things that it is not. "It is not a book, it is not a house, it is not Times Square," etc., etc.  (499)
---
## Implied Negative

> There is an implied sense of negativity in the ability to use words at all. For to use them properly, we must know that they are not the things they stand for. Next, since language is extended by metaphor which gradually becomes the kind of dead metaphor we call abstraction, we must know that metaphor is not literal. Further, we cannot use language maturely until we are spontaneously at home in irony. (That is, if the weather is bad, and someone says, "What a beautiful day!" we spontaneously know that he does not mean what the words say on their face. Children, before reaching "the age of reason," usually find this twist quite disturbing, and are likely to object that it is not a good day. Dramatic irony, of course, carries such a principle of negativity to its most complicated perfection.) (501-2)
---
## Language: Not (Just) a Tool

> Those who begin with the stress upon tools proceed to define language itself as a species of tool. But though instrumentality is an important aspect of language, we could not properly treat it as the essence of language. To define language simply as a species of tool would be like defining metals merely as species of tools. Or like defining sticks and stones simply as primitive weapons. Edward Sapir's view of language as "a collective means of expression" points in a more appropriate direction. The instrumental value of language certainly accounts for much of its development, and this instrumental value of language may even have been responsible for the survival of language itself (by helping the language-using animal to survive), quite as the instrumental value of language in developing atomic power now threatens the survival of the language-using animal; but to say as much is not by any means to say that language is in its essence a tool. Language is a species of action, symbolic action-and its nature is such that it can be used as a tool. (505)
---
class: big
## Destiny Compulsion

> My point is: Why should such a "destiny compulsion" or "repetition compulsion" be viewed as antithetical to the "principle of perfection"? Is not the sufferer exerting almost superhuman efforts in the attempt to give his life a certain form, to so shape his relations to people in later years that they will conform perfectly to an emotional or psychological pattern already established in some earlier formative situation? What more thorough illustrations could one want, of a drive to make one's life "perfect," despite the fact that such efforts at perfection might cause the unconscious striver great suffering? (509)
---
## Perfection is Implicit in Rest of Definition

> The principle of perfection in this dangerous sense derives sustenance from other primary aspects of symbolicity. Thus, the principle of drama is implicit in the idea of action, and the principle of victimage is implicit in the nature of drama. The negative helps radically to define the elements to be victimized. And inasmuch as substitution is a prime resource of symbol-systems, the conditions are set for catharsis by scapegoat (including the "natural" invitation to "project" upon the enemy any troublesome traits of our own that we would negate). And the unresolved problems of "pride" that are intrinsic to privilege also bring the motive of hierarchy to bear here; for many kinds of guilt, resentment, and fear tend to cluster about the hierarchal psychosis, with its corresponding search for a sacrificial principle such as can become embodied in a political scapegoat. (509-10)

## Nuclear War?

> I'm not too sure that, in the present state of Big Technology's confusions, any educational policy, even if it were itself perfect and were adopted throughout the world, would be able to help much, when the world is so ardently beset by so much distress and malice. The dreary likelihood is that, if we do avoid the holocaust, we shall do so mainly by bits of political patch-work here and there, with alliances falling sufficiently on the bias across one another, and thus getting sufficiently in one another's road, so that there's not enough "symmetrical perfection" among the contestants to set up the "right" alignment and touch it off.
