# Invitational Rhetoric
]
---
## Discussion Leader (Jacy)

>With the identification of the rhetorical mode of invitational rhetoric, rhetors will be able to recognize situations in which they seek not to persuade others but simply to create an environment that facilitates understanding, accords value and respect to others’ perspectives, and contributes to the development of relationships of equality. 

With these goals in mind, which modes of communication are best suited for the application of invitational rhetoric, and why? Which modes of communication present obstacles for the application of invitational rhetoric, and what are they?

## Discussion Leader (Allison)

Do you think traditional rhetoric or invitational rhetoric is more effective? Do traditional and invitational styles have to be set up as a dichotomy or is there a space where the two converge?
---
## Discussion Leader (Vanessa)

> The universalist liberal humanism that grounds invitational rhetoric assumes shared interested between oppressors and oppressed, so that conflicts may ostensibly be solved through mutual invitation. In fact, the powerful rarely are willing to invite those less powerful into dialogue the oppresses are hard pressed to convince oppressors who benefit materially from oppression to be open to dialogue, let alone radical change. Many discussions are by “invitation only,” a phrase suggesting that invitation belongs to those who set the rules for exclusion. And when oppressors invite dialogue, we must examine on whose terms and under what conditions that invitation takes place.

Do you think the oppressed always need an invitation to a discussion, or would you say that the oppressed have more liberty than simply “waiting for an invitation to speak”?

Also, do you think this part of the article correlates to the part where Lozano-Reich and Cloud discuss gender inequality? Do you see the men representing the oppressors and the women representing the oppressed?

## Terminological Refiguring

> Burke (1969) suggests that rhetors typically adjust their conduct to the external *resistance* they expect in the audience ... In invitational rhetoric, in contrast, resistance is not anticipated, and rhetors do not adapt their communication to expected resistance in the audience. Instead, they identify possible *impediments* to the creation of understanding and seek to minimize or neutralize them so they do not remain impediments. (Foss & Griffin 6)

> Offering involves not *probing* or *invading* but *giving* ... (Foss & Griffin 7)

> rhetors tend to see their audiences as *opponents* and sometimes may be tempted to engage in questionable ethical practices to win their "*battles*" with them (Foss & Griffin 15).

## Persuasion is Coercion?

> Embedded in efforts to change others is a desire for control and domination, for the act of changing another establishes the power of the change agent over that other. In some instances, the power of the rhetor over another is overt, as it is, for example in laws that exert control over women's bodies ... But even in the cases where the strategies used are less coercive, rhetors who convince others to adopt their viewpoints exert control over part of those others' lives. (Foss & Griffin 3)

## Tradition of Control

> The traditional conception of rhetoric, in summary, is characterized by efforts to change others and thus to gain control over them, self-worth derived from and measured by the power exerted over others, and a devaluation of the life worlds of others. This is a rhetoric of patriarchy, reflecting its values of change, competition, and domination. But these are not the only values on which a rhetorical system can be constructed, and we would like to propose as one alternative a feminist rhetoric. (Foss & Griffin 4)

---
## Patriarchal Bias

> As natural as an equation of rhetoric with persuasion seems for scholars of rhetoric, this conception is only one perspective on rhetoric and one, we suggest, with a patriarchal bias. (Foss & Griffin 2)

---

## Patriarchal Bias

> As natural as an equation of rhetoric with persuasion seems for scholars of rhetoric, this conception is only one perspective on rhetoric and one, we suggest, with a patriarchal bias. (Foss & Griffin 2)

> Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.

> — bell hooks, *Understanding Patriarchy*, pg 1

> What makes it feminist is not its use by a particular population of rhetors but rather the grounding of its assumptions in feminist principles and theories. (Foss & Griffin 5)

## Definition

> Invitational rhetoric is an invitation to understanding as a means to create a relationship rooted in *equality*, *immanent value*, and *self-determiniation*. Invitational rhetoric constitutes an invitation to the audience to enter the rhetor's world and to see it as the rhetor does. In presenting a particular perspective, the invitational rhetor does not judge or denigrate others' perspectives but is open to and tries to appreciate and validate those perspectives, even if they differ dramatically from the rhetor's own. Ideally, audience members accept the invitation offered by the rhetor by listening to and trying to understand the rhetor's perspective and then presenting their own. When this happens, rhetor and audience alike contribute to the thinking about an issue so that everyone involved gains a greater understanding of the issue in its subtlety, richness, and complexity. (Foss & Griffin 5)

## Rhetoric is a Battlefield?

> Invitational rhetoric may serve as a way to allow these scholars to develop models for interaction not characterized by the opposition and competition that make the achievement of their goal difficult.

## Changing Change

> Change may be the result of invitational rhetoric, but change is not its purpose. When change does occur as a result of understanding, it is different from the kind of change that typifies the persuasive interactions of traditional rhetoric. In the traditional model, change is defined as a shift in the audience in the direction requested by the rhetor, who then has gained some measure of power and control over the audience. In invitational rhetoric, change occurs in the audience or rhetor or both as a result of new understanding and insights gained in the exchange of ideas. (Foss & Griffin 6)

---
## Safety and Systems

> The three external conditions of safety, value, and freedom required for others to present their perspectives were created by the speech. The rhetors communicated safety when they suggested that they regarded the perspective of the judges as legitimate one that they would treat with respect and care. (Foss & Griffin 13)

> Although invitational rhetoric is not designed to create a specific change, such as the transformation of system of oppression into ones that value and nurture individuals, it may produce such an outcome. Invitational rhetoric may resist an oppressive system simply because it models an alternative to the system ... (Foss & Griffin 16-17)

## Equality and Invitation

> Yet, as Bone et al. acknowledge, the suitability of the invitational paradigm is not universal; it presupposes conditions of economic, political, and social equality between and among interlocutors. However, such conditions of actual equality are rare in political controversy and interpersonal relations. (Lazano-Reich & Cloud 221)

---
class: big
## Violence and Persuasion

> Bone et al. recognize that persuasion and even violence are sometimes necessary for the successful resolution of conflict. Yet their examples equate persuasion with violence, whereas disruptive tactics like sit-ins are described as examples of invitational rhetoric. Violence and persuasion should be conceptualized as distinct; there is nothing invitational about purposeful public disruption when previous invitations have been ignored. (Lazano-Reich & Cloud 221)

---

## Wordplay, Again

> Furthermore, some sorts of "invitation"—for example, to come to the principal’s office, or to make overdue credit card payments—are indeed coercive. (Lazano-Reich & Cloud 221)

> Many discussions are by "invitation only," a phrase suggesting that invitation belongs to those who set the rules for exclusion. And when oppressors invite dialogue, we must examine on whose terms and under what conditions that invitation takes place. (Lazano-Reich & Cloud 222)

---
## Civility?

> Bone et al. claim that civility fosters democracy. While voting is indeed civil, radical social change has not occurred in voting booths, but results, instead, from democratic grassroots tactics. Protestors inherently do not operate within the realm of decorum. Indeed, political confrontations up to and including violence have been perennial resources in struggles for justice (Kirkpatrick, 2008). The civility standard is detrimental to this project. When measured by standards of civility, protesters are framed as wild and riotous by dominant media, rendering their struggles illegitimate (Gitlin, 2003). In a post-9-11 climate, moreover, "uncivil" protestors are equated with terrorists (and terrorists cannot be ascribed any rationality whatsoever). (Lazano-Reich & Cloud 224)
