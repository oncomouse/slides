# Michel Foucault & Barbara A. Biesecker

class: big
## Discussion Leader (Sarah)

> Bentham was surprised that panoptic institutions could be so light: there were no more bars, no more chains, no more heavy locks; all that was needed was that the separations should be clear and the openings well arranged. The heaviness of the old 'houses of security', with their fortress-like architecture, could be replaced by the simple, economic geometry of a 'house of certainty'.

How does Foucault argue that the Panopticon represent both discipline and punishment in a postmodern society? Why is the Panopticon design critical to a modern society?

## Discussion Leader (Linda)

If the Panopticon theory is similar to that of Max Weber’s bureaucratic management ways, and Weber’s management style was ineffective, what type of management styles is most effective? What management style is in your workplace?

## Famous Slogan

> Visibility is a trap.
>
> To begin with, this made it possible - as a negative effect - to avoid those compact, swarming, howling masses that were to be found in places of confinement, those painted by Goya or described by Howard. Each individual, in his place, is securely confined to a cell from which he is seen from the front by the supervisor; but the side walls prevent him from coming into contact with his companions. He is seen, but he does not see; he is the object of information, never a subject in communication.

## How It Works

> The arrangement of his room, opposite the central tower, imposes on him an axial visibility; but the divisions of the ring, those separated cells, imply a lateral invisibility. And this invisibility is a guarantee of order. If the inmates are convicts, there is no danger of a plot, an attempt at collective escape, the planning of new crimes for the future, bad reciprocal influences; if they are patients, there is no danger of contagion; if they are madmen there is no risk of their committing violence upon one another; if they are schoolchildren, there is no copying, no noise, no chatter, no waste of time; if they are workers, there are no disorders, no theft, no coalitions, none of those distractions that slow down the rate of work, make it less perfect or cause accidents. The crowd, a compact mass, a locus of multiple exchanges, individualities merging together, a collective effect, is abolished and replaced by a collection of separated individualities. From the point of view of the guardian, it is replaced by a multiplicity that can be numbered and supervised; from the point of view of the inmates, by a sequestered and observed solitude.
---
## Panotpic Subjectivity

> Hence the major effect of the Panopticon: to induce in the inmate a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power. So to arrange things that the surveillance is permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its action; that the perfection of power should tend to render its actual exercise unnecessary; that this architectural apparatus should be a machine for creating and sustaining a power relation independent of the person who exercises it; in short, that the inmates should be caught up in a power situation of which they are themselves the bearers ...

> The more numerous those anonymous and temporary observers are, the greater the risk for the inmate of being surprised and the greater his anxious awareness of being observed. The Panopticon is a marvellous machine which, whatever use one may wish to put it to, produces homogeneous effects of power.
>
>A real subjection is born mechanically from a fictitious relation.

## Biopower: Individual as Data Point

>  But the Panopticon was also a laboratory; it could be used as a machine to carry out experiments, to alter behaviour, to train or correct individuals. To experiment with medicines and monitor their effects. To try out different punishments on prisoners, according to their crimes and character, and to seek the most effective ones. To teach different techniques simultaneously to the workers, to decide which is the best. To try out pedagogical experiments - and in particular to take up once again the well-debated problem of secluded education, by using orphans. One would see what would happen when, in their sixteenth or eighteenth year, they were presented with other boys or girls; one could verify whether, as Helvetius thought, anyone could learn anything; one would follow 'the genealogy of every observable idea'; one could bring up different children according to different systems of thought, making certain children believe that two and two do not make four or that the moon is a cheese, then put them together when they are twenty or twenty-five years old; ... The Panopticon is a privileged place for experiments on men, and for analysing with complete certainty the transformations that may be obtained from them.

## The Problem w/ Foucault and Rhetoric

>  Rhetorical Studies is a discipline animated by a profoundly utopian yearning. By and large, its practitioners operate out of the firm conviction that things can change, be otherwise, different - in fact better - provided that human beings intervene symbolically in a history that is of their own making. It is for this reason one may find it odd that rhetorical theorists and critics are beginning to turn to the work of Michel Foucault, a continental philosopher whose early and middle writings are understood by most readers to have made visible the ways in which "the subject of history is but the product of apparatuses of power/knowledge" (Biesecker 351)
---
## Repression -> Knowledge

> seems to me that much of Foucault 's work is geared toward uprooting the very notion that it is in knowledge and speech that our liberation hangs in the balance ...
>
>  To be sure, Foucault's historically grounded rereading of the repressive hypothesis (the hypothesis that power relations hearing on sexuality always take the form of prohibition, censorship, or non-recognition) completely alters the meaning of censorship by seeing in it not a ban on talk about sex but, instead, a mechanism for the production of a Virtual explosion of discourses on sexuality. (Biesecker 353)

## Power as "Can Do"

>  On this reading of Foucault, power names not the imposition of a limit that constrains human thought and action but a being-able that is made possible by a grid of intelligibility. Power is a human calculation performed within and inaugurated by the "lines of mak- ing sense" that are operative at a particular historical moment or, as Spivak put it, a "can-do"-ness whose condition of existence is an orientation in time and space. (Biesecker 356)
---
## Resistance as Non-Signification

>  What becomes clear, second, is that those practices that we will cali "resistant" are, quite simply or nominalistically speaking, those practices that do not make sense within the available Unes of intelligibility or discernment. That is, they do not signify (which is to say, make meaning) because they cannot be referenced within the field. Hence, resistant practices are gestures that defy translation, throw sense off track, and, thus, short-circuit the System through which sense is made. In short, resistance names the nonlegible practices that are performed within the weave but are asymmetrical to it. As Foucault put it, "They are the odd term in relations of power." (Biesecker 357)

## Rhetoric's Purpose

> We might say, then, that a criticai rhetoric is a timely discourse whose task is not, as we have heretofore thought, one of "changing what's in people's heads." Instead, it is about turning the grid of intelligibility that organizes the present in such a way that it becomes possible "to transform the critique conducted in the form of necessary limitation into a practical critique that takes the form of a possible transgression" out of which "new forms of community, co-existence, pleasure" will emerge. (Biesecker 361-2)
