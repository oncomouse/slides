### Prompt

Pick two of the various rhetorical theories of subjectivity we have read in this unit (or ones you find in a text from the first unit). Compare and contrast these two theories. Specifically, think about what is enabled and what is disabled by the two theories. Evaluate these two compared theories using a framework of your own design (grounding in a specific context, for accomplishing a specific task, etc).

## Discussion Leader (Allison)

> So it is not simply that there is something “immaterial … in man” from which “self-knowledge arises,” as Linnaeus implied, but that this immaterial “something,” this preoriginary rhetoricity, is the very condition for the identity and functioning of any living being. To be what it is, a being must mark itself (off from the other) repeatedly in a gesture of self-reference; repeating itself to gather itself, it must both leave and trace traces, address and respond. The trace, Derrida writes, “must be thought before the entity” (1997, 47): a kind of zoography before zoology, rhetoricity before ontology. The trace—the entwinement of the other in the same that makes the “same” possible—is already the heart of any sign; it’s the most basic unit of communication, and it’s not simply human. (547)

Do you agree with Davis' assertion that self-awareness is rhetoric or is self-awareness merely a requirement of rhetoric? Is Davis' definition of rhetoric so vague that it leaves traditional rhetoric indistinguishable from other phenomena?

## Discussion Leader (Katherine)

> ...Rhetoricians have been...embracing and endlessly retracing what they consider—despite everything—to be the single, irrefutable distinction between “the human” and “the animal.” Some of the most (otherwise) nonfoundational thinkers devote themselves to this Cartesian dichotomy, including, as Jacques Derrida demonstrates, Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Lacan. Rhetorical studies has been less committed to spotlighting or inspecting this indivisible line than to presuming it. Rhetorical acts are held to be distinctly human acts inasmuch as they’re grounded not so much in the power to speak (certain birds can do that) but in a more originary capability for self-reflexivity. (535)

If there was another animal that was self-reflexive like humans, how would that change human's view of themselves? Would we be able to get along with another species? Why is it so important to us that we separate ourselves from animals? 
---
### Knowledge and Humans

> Next to this generic name, however, Linnaeus does not record a distinguishing characteristic, as he does for all the other entries, but instead issues an imperative: “Nosce te ipsum” (“Know yourself”) ...
>
> From the perspective of morality, Linnaeus concedes that there is “a splendidly great difference” between “a man and a bestia.” “Man is the animal,” he writes, “which the Creator has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent mind and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life” (qtd. in Broberg 1994, 167). However, from the perspective of natural history, his “workshop,” he insists that human beings are not distinguishable from apes and that the best possible way to articulate a distinction is through the imperative: “Nosce te ipsum” (Broberg 1994, 171). What distinguishes a human being from a bestia emerges only in the unique manner of existence opened for the being who knows itself. Human beings, precisely in knowing who they are, become who they are and demonstrate their defining characteristic. “Nosce te ipsum” means, for him, something like: become yourself—or remain the ape that you also (zoologically) are. (533-534)

### The Story Goes: Saying "I"

> Rhetorical studies has been less committed to spotlighting or inspecting this indivisible line than to presuming it. Rhetorical acts are held to be distinctly human acts inasmuch as they’re grounded not so much in the power to speak (certain birds can do that) but in a more originary capability for self-reflexivity. **In both philosophy and rhetoric, at least since Descartes, autodeixis, the self-reflexive power of the I—which already means “I am” or “I think”—has been considered the condition for language acquisition, as reason and thought more generally depend on “the ipseity of being able to be or able to do ‘I,’” as Derrida puts it, “even before any autoreferential utterance in language” (2008, 92). A parrot, a myna, a parakeet may imitate human speech—may even say “I”—but without this self-reflexive capacity it could not have a clue what it’s saying. These birds don’t have language, it is argued, but possess instead an instinctive (and sometimes freakishly convincing) ability to imitate the being who has language.** (534-535)

### The Story Goes: Animals Don't React

> Without access to an autoreferential I and so without a representable sense of self, the argument goes, animals are completely determined by and identical to their genetic coding: they are, in the words of George Bataille, “in the world like water in water” (1989, 24). That is to say, “the animal” reacts according to the repetitive mechanicity of its programming, but because it cannot access a necessary self-distance—because it cannot step back from itself into a kind of reflective clearing in order to recognize itself—it cannot know or refer to itself as itself. It can never get its head above “the water,” so to speak, and therefore can never authentically respond to a question or a situation. (536)
---
### But, Do We Say "I"?

> The putatively solid border between human and animal grounds the history of philosophy, Judeo-Christian religions, Western culture itself; politics, law, and ethics are erected on it, and the very idea of human rights requires it. Yet we now know that certain animals pass the same mirror test used to determine self-recognition in human children; many more use tools, share distinct languages and complex social interactions, have a sense of past and future, pass knowledge from one generation to the next, and indicate varying propensities for laughter, grief, deception, empathy, and shame. It would be difficult to overestimate what’s at stake in these discoveries, which contest the opposition by which the figure of the responding and responsible human subject is secured: a bestia presumed to be incapable of response. The question now is not whether animals have powers humans have denied them so much as whether humans have the power to be or to do I in the way that philosophy and rhetorical studies have presumed. (536)
---
### Irreducible "I"

>For our purposes here, what this research exposes is the practically unfathomable scope and significance of rhetorical operations, which were never simply human. An underivable rhetoricity is the immaterial “something” from which a presumption of “self-knowledge arises,” I’ll argue: it’s not an innate quality “in man” but the already relational condition for any living being who presumes to recognize and refer to him- or herself. The I is generated, each time, in the gap between me and myself, between the one recognizing and the one recognized, where an extrahuman rhetorical relation plays itself out. My aim is to call rhetorical studies “home”—to its unhomey, preontological, ahuman home—by exposing an irreducible rhetoricity as the condition for the presumption of any I. (536-7)

---
### Rhetoricity

> “rhetoric” is itself dependent on an always prior rhetoricity, an affect *ability* or persuad *ability* that is due not to any creature’s specific genetic makeup but to corporality more generally, to the exposedness of corporeal existence. To be affectable, persuadable, is to be always already affected, persuaded, which means: always already responsive. Rhetoric is not first of all an essence or property “in the speaker” (a natural function of biology) but an underivable obligation to respond that issues from an irreducible relationality. (Davis, "Creaturely Rhetorics", 89)

> Any creature capable of even minimal self-reference is already in language, already responding; that is to say, it is both defined by its irreducible rhetoricity and, more importantly for our purposes, already practicing rhetoric.  (Davis, "Creaturely Rhetorics", 92)

### Conjuring

> Autodeixis is a kind of conjuring power, a seemingly magical (performative) capacity thought to summon a human being from the zoological body of an ape. It names an exceptional sort of autoaffection in which a being refers to itself not as such but as if in the “living present” of its own self- presence: “I.” (540)
---
### Why Autobiography: Self is Narrative

> *I* can only ever point or refer to an other who is already gone, an other who is ahead of me or behind me or even in me. The curious accomplishment of the I involves something like “the human” pointing to the effaced traces of an animal presumed to be incapable of pointing. The I, which can only be self-reflexive, autobiographical, nonetheless cannot point to its self, no more than “the animal” can—the animal that *therefore* “I am” (following). In French, Derrida notes, “Je suis” means both “I am” and “I follow.” With all due respect to Descartes on the one hand, and to the Elephant Man on the extreme other, I am/is indeed an animal—or else its only task is to follow one, to decipher its traces, to give it face and voice, to write its auto-bio-graphy. “What this animal is, what it will have been, what it would, would like to, or could be,” Derrida writes, “is perhaps what *I am* following” (2008, 33).
---
### Autobiography: Signing Off as The Self

> The built-in guarantee of the “auto-bio-graphical” derives from the fact that that “I”—though infinitely reproducible, imitable, citable—presents itself *as (if)* a *sign of life*. To pose oneself as an I is already to sign for or sign off on the living self. Autobiography is the inscription of self-reference (“I”), and yet I is not and cannot be simply present to itself, identical to itself; it’s always “speaking of another, … quoting another” (2008, 57). And the self to which “I” refers, as Derrida puts it in his reading of de Man, “only appears to itself in this bereaved allegory, in this hallucinatory prosopopoeia” (1989, 28). (541)
---
### Autobiography: Never Seal the Deal

> he autobiographical animal conjures itself but never finally gets to itself or becomes itself, which is maybe why “know yourself” had to be inscribed as an eternal imperative. Autobiography is not a genre, says de Man, but a figure of understanding that involves the stitching together of disparate traces, which not even the most profound narrative power can pull to a close. A gesture of aberrant performative positings, autobiography’s task is to make present the self to which the “I” refers, but it can never close the deal. (543)
---
### Autobiography: Not Just For Humans

> ut on the other hand, perhaps autodeixis is not strictly human. Bottlenose dolphins, elephants, orcas, magpies, and all the great apes respond to their reflections *as if* in the living present of their own self- presence: in addition to picking at the mark placed on them by researchers, they may check their teeth, fluff their fur, explore facial expressions or bodily gestures. Looking at themselves, and so already not-one, these animals embrace as themselves the hallucinatory protagonist “recognized” in the mirror, presuming to do the I without saying it, without speaking it. And this is not simply an ocular phenomenon. A recent study conducted by biologists, for example, found that bottlenose dolphins “develop individually distinctive … ‘signature whistles.’” (544-5)
---
### Leaving Traces, Making Marks

> So it is not simply that there is something “immaterial … in man” from which “self-knowledge arises,” as Linnaeus implied, but that this immaterial “something,” this preoriginary rhetoricity, is the very condition for the identity and functioning of any living being. To be what it is, a being must mark itself (off from the other) repeatedly in a gesture of self-reference; repeating itself to gather itself, it must both leave and trace traces, address and respond. (547)

> his rhetoricity cannot be innate because it cannot *not* be relational: without an other, a trace of differentiation, there is no need or possibility for self-reference. The I, posing itself in its “living presence,” is already an effect of what we might call this rhetoricity of the living, a specter born each time in an underivable and extrahuman rhetorical relation. (548)
