# Michelle Ballif, "Writing the Third-Sophistic Cyborg"
---
## Discussion Leader (Ty)

> The Third Sophist, contrariwise, is suggesting a rhetorical situation negotiated by *mêtis* rather than mastered by *technê*; and the cunning Cyborg is the figure (which is not One, but a network) that navigates the postmodern discursive world, characterized by the ecstasy of communication 'where meaning is dismembered and scattered to the wind' (Baudrillard, *Illusion* 121) and by civic bodies who, in Gorgias's words 'neither remember the past nor observe the present nor prophesy the future' (132).

Is this process of decision making good, one in which mistakes from the past are not remembered and no future consequences are thought of when making a decision now? What does Gorgias mean when he says "nor observe the present"?

---

>Their persuasions by means of fictions are innumerable; for if everyone had recollection of the past, knowledge of the present, and foreknowledge of the future, the power of speech (logos) would not be so great.  But as it is, when men can neither remember the past nor observe the present nor prophesy the future, deception is easy; so that most men offer opinion (*nomos*) as advice to the soul. But opinion, being unreliable, involves those who accept it in equally uncertain fortunes. (Gorgias, *Encomium of Helen* 11)

## Discussion Leader (Colton)

> This future anterior doesn't deny that there is a past, doesn't dismiss the work of historical materialism; nor does it deny that there is a present, doesn't dismiss the "reality" of social and political lived conditions; this future anterior doesn't deny that there is a future; doesn't dismiss the harbingers of radical democracy. Rather, it attends to the transpolitical moment of this postmodern age via a transrhetoric—a rhetoric to come (I will more carefully articulate such below)—and thereby services a "democracy to come" (Derrida): "not a democracy that claims to instantiate justice here and now, not an apologetics for actually existing liberal democracy (but neither a dismissal of the latter), but a democracy guided by the futural or projective transcendence of justice" (Critchley 36). The future anterior (or what I will associate below with a Third-Sophistic rhetoric [Vitanza]) is not a Utopian pronouncement or dispensation but rather, according to Derrida, it "happens in the singular event of engagement, and when I speak of democracy to come (la démocratie a venir) this does not mean that tomorrow democracy will be realized, and it does not refer to a future democracy, rather it means that there is an engagement with regard to democracy which consists in recognizing the irreducibility of the promise when, in the messianic moment, 'it can come' (‘ca peut venir')…. This is not Utopian, it is what takes place here and now, in a here and now that I regularly try to dissociate from the present" (83). (Ballif 55)

This passage is significant because it highlights a postmodern departure from traditional notions of time (past, present, & future) which is used as a premise and an exigence for Ballif’s subsequent theory of “Third Sophistic postmodern posthuman transrhetoric(s)” (56). Ignoring Ballif’s postmodernist brouhaha, what is the transpolitical moment that the future anterior is supposed to be addressing with transrhetoric?

## Crisis of Democracy

> Viewed from the political right or the political left, our *fin de siècle* America is seen as experiencing a crisis of democracy, evidenced by the inequities lived according to race, class, gender, and sexual orientation, by die fact that all people are, thus, not viewed as created equally before the law, by the fact that our so-called, elected, political representatives don't accurately represent their constituencies, by the fact that education—the so-called guarantor of democratic citizenship—is not equally dispensed ... 
>
> Whatever the origin of our present tense ... the crisis can only be attended to, I am suggesting, *rhetorically*. That is, a political crisis instantiates a rhetorical crisis. This claim is, of course,a commonplace for anyone familiar with die mythology attending the "origin ofr hetoric," where rhetoric appears, in Vincent Farenga's words, simultaneously witha "catastrophic breach in the social order," in the "hiatus between the political orders of tyranny and democracy" (1035). (51)

## Sophists

> This growing recognition of the inadequacies (including the inherent classism and racism) of Aristotelian rhetoric has led many to reevaluate sophistic rhetoric as a discursive practice, as a "New Rhetoric" for the people, that could encourage democratic practices in our multicultural America Sophistic rhetoric, thus, has been identified as a democracy-building alternative to Aristotelian rhetoric. John Poulakos writes: "Contrary to what some of their critics have said, the sophists' motto was not the survival of the fittest but fitting as many as possible for survival. In this sense, the sophists can be said to have helped strengthen the recently instituted democracy by forging a mentality aware of the centrality of persuasion in the coordination of sociopolitical action and the resolution of human conflicts" (14).

## Beyond Aristotle I

> Although Aristotle's temporal and functional definitions of rhetoric may have accurately represented classical discourse, they now—on the eve of the twenty-first century—strike us as lacking, particularly since the advent of the technological age. The postmodern challenges to history, to politics, to communications, to political agency, along with our increasing digital and virtual experiences, have radically altered our conceptions of time, place, and rhetorical purpose, and have led us to question the form of a body politic that rhetoric (a body of discourse) constructs. What, then, are the prospects for rhetoric when the terms of the triad (including "speaker" [*ethos*], "audience" [*pathos*], and "message" [*logos*]), which have long since defined rhetoric, are rendered referentless? What are the prospects for rhetoric when historical temporality (i.e., "past," "present," and "future") is challenged? (52-3)

## *Mêtis*

> Rather than attempting to codify and rationalize a sophistic practice, I am suggesting that we should ignore such Platonic sophist-baiting and stop trying to prove that sophistry is a *technê*. Rather, we could consider sophistry as *mêtis*, a sophistic quality that eludes Platonic hunters. *Mêtis* is a knowing, doing, and making not in regards to Truth (either certain or probable), but in regards to a "transient, shifting, disconcerting and ambiguous" situation such as our postmodern condition (Détienne and Vernant 3).

## Beyond Aristotle II

> Jean Baudrillard argues that we are on the other side of the crisis of representation, having entered a new stage of simulation, wherein there is no longer anyreferent and, hence, no longer any representation (since there is no referent torepresent). Baudrillard, borrowing from the mathematical theory of fractals, callsour current state of simulation the "fractal stage." In fractal mathematics onecannot rely on a common-sense referent or perception of it For example, thereis no referent of a "straight line"; rather, Charles Levin explains, it is "just anabstract idea," which can never really be seen. "Viewed microscopically, anyexample of a line reveals a jagged and broken thread, endlessly deviating fromthe straight and narrow" (Levin 272). Likewise, Baudrillard is suggesting that"history" is just such a conception that can never be "seen" or realized. If wecould somehow look at "history" under a microscope, all we would see is "a sortof proliferation and problematic dispersal" ("Transpolitics" 16). This prolifera-tion or "metastasis" of history is indicative, according to Baudrillard, of a loss of any reference "whatsoever except by mere contiguity" ("Transpolitics" 15). Hence his point that within the fractal stage, temporality itself has lost its sense of reference. (53-4)

## Rhetoric without History

> Therefore, given today's ahistorical epistemological framework and the temporal, historical grounding of the new rhetorics, it seems strange that such rhetorics are so advocated. As you recall, Aristotle claims that there are three species of rhetoric: deliberative, forensic, and epideictic. Each of these has its own "time": "for the deliberative speaker, the future (for whether exhorting or dissuading he advises about future events); for the speaker in court, the past (for he always prosecutes or defends concerning what has been done); in epideictic the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often also make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future" (1358b). Yet, according to Jean-Francois Lyotard, with the collapse of the "grand narratives" that guarantee temporality, that sustain history, and that give meaning to the story of the past, the context for our present, and the trajectory for our future, how can we distinguish along with Aristotle the species and functions of rhetoric? After the crisis of representation, rhetoric cannot represent or appeal to any event, guarantee its existence, its occurrence, or its remembrance. (54)

## The Cyborg?

> A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. (Haraway 149)

> By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the traditions of 'Western' science and politics--the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other - the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. (Haraway 150)
---
## Cyborgs and History

> Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection-they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential. (Haraway 151)
---
## The Cyborg Machine

> The second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man's dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. (Haraway 152)

## Partiality and Wholeness

> So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific culture ... the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.
> 
> From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war. From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. (Haraway 154)

## Critique of the Cyborg

> We acknowledge that the Cyborg is not, somehow, an essentially transgressive figure, but rather a figure profoundly complicit with the machinations of power and the technologies of the self. The Cyborg is indisputably a "socially and technologically contested site" (Johnson-Eilola, "Control" 391). Unlike many theorists of the electronic age, I do not posit that the Cyborg is presaging a glorious future, that the Cyborg is necessarily a "liberatory" figure. Along with its detractors, I agree that we "may be [re]colonizing ourselves and others as we begin to write, read and live with (and within) electronic information spaces such as hypertext" (Johnson-Eilola 383), that we may be constituting an electronic panopticon, and as Anne Balsamo argues we may be obscuring "the disciplining and surveillant consequences of these [bio-]technologies—in short, the biopolitics of technological formations" (5). Additionally, Bill Covino argues that the Cyborg is "hyperconventional rather than an infidel" (370). (62)

## *Mêtis*, *Tuchê*, *Technê*

> Therefore, as we are familiar, when Plato, in the dialogue *Gorgias*, condemns rhetoric because it is not a *technê*, he is arguing that rhetoric, like *mêtis*, is characterized by trickery and stratagem, and remains a stochastic intelligence, not rational, ordered, nor measurable. True rhetoric opposes *tuchê* or chance, rather than negotiates it, as does *mêtis*. What Plato prescribes in the *Phaedrus* is a discursive universe in which *tuchê*, *mêtis*, and *kairos* must be controlled and/or excised. Plato's theory and vision of rhetoric presupposes a knowledge and wis- dom that is measurable and universal. (66)

## Cyborg, Navigator

> A Cyborg, as the embodiment of posthuman transrhetorical practices, is figured as a navigator, endowed with *mêtis*, faced with an uncertain future, a postmodern expanse where "contrary winds from opposite quarters of the sky can blow within a single moment" (Pindar, qtd. in Détienne and Vemant 225), the Cyborg can only negotiate it by demonstrating that he/she himself/herself is similarly polymorphic and can trope accordingly. Thus the cunning Cyborg (although still a state—now global [Gabilondo]—apparatus, to be sure) can—like Hephaestus—"forge" ahead, or sideways, into virtual spaces and temporalities, crafting a future anterior, an [in]tense rhetorical moment characterized by the forces of *technê*, but also *mêtis*, *tuchê*, and *kairos*, according to the occasion, vacillating moments and opportunities—and by the relativity of argument and truth. In short, different rhetorical moments occasion different rhetorics. (67)
