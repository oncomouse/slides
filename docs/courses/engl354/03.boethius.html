# Boethius, "An Overview of the Structure of Rhetoric"
---
class: f37px
## Rhetoric is a System

> The angry disputes which center about the rules governing each of its parts may lead to a serious error: [Readers] may investigate each of the separate parts of the act and ignore the final product. It is this treatment of the whole, heretofore neglected, to which we now address ourselves as best we can. (70)

## Spaces of Rhetoric

> So a civil question can take any of the forms: when it seeks the ends of justice in a court of law, it becomes judicial; when it asks in an assembly what is useful or proper, then it is a deliberative act; and when it proclaims publicly what is good, the civil question becomes demonstrative rhetoric.

> But, since these are the parts of the faculty of rhetoric and since they comprise the whole of that faculty, it is absolutely necessary that wherever rhetoric is to be used, they must be present as well. Now if rhetoric is completely present in each of its species, then all these parts must be present in each of the species. (72)

## Rhetorical Tools

> Since nearly every faculty must use a tool to accomplish what it can do, we must look for some tool here. That tool is the **oration**, which is sometimes of a civil nature, sometimes not. We are speaking now of the [rhetorical], which deals with some such question or is designed to expedite a solution to such a question. When that kind of oration treats an issue of civil importance, it moves forward without a break in continuity; when it does not deal with matters of public concern, it is developed through questions and answer. The former is **rhetoric**, the latter is called **dialectic**. (72)

## Six Parts of a Rhetorical Oration

1. The introduction or exordium
1. The argument ("narration" normally)
1. The partition
1. The proof
1. The refutation
1. The peroration

## Duties of Rhetoric

Boethius gives two:

* To teach
* To move

Cicero classically offers a third:

* To delight
---
class: big
## Subdivision

> ... the same duty falls no less to the lot of these six elements, which are parts of the oration. Now the parts of rhetoric, being parts of a faculty, are themselves faculties; therefore the tools which work in the entire oration must also function in each part of the oration, and so they must be present in order to work.
