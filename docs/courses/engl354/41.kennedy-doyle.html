## Rhetoric is Prior to Intentionality

> Actually there is even a kind of rhetoric among plants. Though clearly lacking in conscious intent, it is essential for the survival of the species. The term colors of rhetoric was frequently used in the past to describe figures of speech. The colors of flowers attract insects and birds and facilitate pollination. Plants also use odors to attract or repel animais. Coloration and scent are each a kind of rhetoric and the creation and perception of each involves the use of energy. This is purposive in nature, though not purposeful. (10)

## The Function of Rhetoric is the Survival of the Fittest

> Rhetoric acts as a mechanism for survival by facilitating successful adaptation of an organism to environmental change. Genetic mutation benefits the species by providing increased options for adaptation, but does little or nothing for the progenitive organism; within animal cultures, however, including human culture, rhetoric is a powerful force for the survival and well-being of the individual, the family, and the social group as these exist at any given moment.

## The Rhetorical Code Evolves by Selective Variation

> Nature selects for survival those individuals whose skills are most adaptive to their environment. Selective variation in rhetoric probably orìginates in small "mistakes" in using either a nonhuman or human code, in novel combinations of its conventional elements, or chance experimentation or play that proves more effective than what has traditionally been done and is imitated. At some point in history, some human being hit upon the novelty of giving a reason for a command, and kept on doing it when a rational audience responded well. Among higher animais, rhetorical skills are transmitted culturally by imitation and learning, not genetically. (11)

## Delivery is Prior to Others

> "Delivery" in traditional rhetoric includes facial expression, gesture, and tonal inflection. In Latin, the term *actio* was often used instead, and it is action, not subtleties of vocalization, to which I refer here. Physical motion in response to some exigence occurs in the earliest and most primitive forms of life, as when an amoeba moves toward a food supply or away from some noxious stimulus. A kind of proto-rhetoric can be said to exist in those creatures that can react to a challenge by change of color or shape or by spewing out some substance as does an octopus. Some action produces sound, which other creatures can perceive although the originator of the sound may not. (12)

## Ethos, Pathos, Logos in the Wild

> I would describe this as deliberative rhetoric in that in a particular social context it implies advice about future action be wary, or flee and the receiver needs to make a judgment. I would also suggest that elements of ethos, pathos, and logos are inherent in it. The originator of the communication, whether consciously or not, has given a sign of his credibility and good will (ethos), has expressed with more or less emphasis his alarm and produced a message that can awaken alarm in his audience (pathos), and has indicated why he feels alarm by giving the call that denotes a predator (logos).

## Network, Writing, Mind

> While such a webby map of mind might appear driven by the *parataxis*. of digital information technologies and their drift, Donald introduces this. sense of exteriority through the media technology that put Plato or, at least, the character of Socrates, into a panic: writing. In contact with practices of literacy, Donald argues, the brain undergoes a transformation of its. functional anatomy—the scribal mind now emerges from a distributed network. Donald treats the evolution of “external symbolic storage” as the brain’s new memory ally, a transformative one that enabled new kinds of prediction, social organization, and identity (27).

## Chemistry, Rhythm, Communication

>  [Donald] We are asked to handle now broadswords, now biplanes, now remote microsurgical hands. (2000, 36)
>
> We are essentially flexible organisms, due in part to the enormous dexterity of the mind-hand nexus invoked here by Donald in his rhythmic *repetitio* of “now.” So too is mind essentially flexible and subject to persuasion and alteration by the entire bramble of “brain-culture chemistry.” As Donald’s exuberant recourse to the rhetorical triplet “now … now … now” might remind us, even such technical communication involves the transformation of consciousness through chanting rhythms as well as more properly semantic information. (30-1)

## Persuasion or Seduction

> A return to our example of bird brains is instructive. If, with Charles Darwin, we remember that zebra finches and humans both likely replicate song and language in response to the pressures of sexual selection, we are then in a position to understand the strange persistence of ecodelics in the human toolkit. For practices of sexual selection—think the rhythm of grasshopper stridulation, think the flutter of a peacock feather, think the practiced warble of birdsong, the bugle and musk of deer—cultivate replicable traits in the evolution of reproduction by selecting not only for survival, but for *seduction*. (31-2)

class: f25px
## From Danger to Seduction

> The usual thought experiment summoned when imagining the evolutionary emergence of traits is danger—a tiger is often invoked as the ultimate challenge to the homind brain. No doubt such danger was an intensive vector—the “killer frisbee” and “Swiss army knife” of early humans, the handaxe, was clearly a hunting adjunct, carcass cleaning tool, and personal defense technology. Yet seduction, and its continual use of drugs, also informed and entrained the human brain into its contemporary capacities. Note that the cultural invention most associated with the brain in Donald’s treatment is memory, and for what is the memory used? The recall of “entire pharmacopieas” is perhaps not merely one memory among others, but a memory whose (rhetorical) replication is deeply implicated in the differential survival and evolution of human beings. (32-3)
