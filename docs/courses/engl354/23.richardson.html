# Timothy Richardson, "The Authenticity of What's Next"
---
class: f24px
## "Authentic"

> An inexpensive brand of tortilla chips happened to have the slogan “Authentic Mexican Style” emblazoned on the bag, and through it I encountered a specific instance of an old postcolonial trope: “Authentic Mexican Style” only makes sense outside of (perhaps a mythic) Mexico, where there presumably wouldn’t be a question of authenticity. Of course, if we happen to be in Mexico, we might go smaller, regional, and say “authentic Veracruz style,” but only if we aren’t in that city or its surrounding area (or if we are in the city but trying to appeal to tourists who don’t know any better). Thus, authenticity may be a way of marking a lack or absence *here* with the presence of some (poorer or simply displaced) representative. And in this same way, parts of major cities devoted primarily to one ethnicity—Little Italy, Chinatown, etc—are likewise homely for some people precisely because they are not home. The claim of authenticity depends on there being a distance and, frequently, a move to cover that distance.

---

## Temporal vs Spatial Distance

> This distance needn’t be spatial; it could also be temporal. The fantastically precise set-and-costume design of the 1960s in the AMC television show *Mad Men* demonstrates that the *je ne sais quoi* of authenticity comes from poring over old design magazines and advertisements and overloading the viewers with precision. Even those of us (especially those of us?) who weren’t alive for most of that decade feel that something “true” is being performed. The *useful* past comes from the present stagecraft. A performance is authentic because we believe its accuracy from this distance: “It just couldn’t be closer to the truth” also means it’s not the truth. Closing the distance is a useful fantasy: “It just draws you in.”

## Aura

> Walter Benjamin complains that the aura of authenticity “withers” in the age of mechanical reproduction such that
>
> .indent[the technique of reproduction detaches the reproduced object from the domain of tradition. By making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it reactivates the object reproduced. (1235)]
>
> Benjamin is invested in making authenticity as much about the place of the object as possible. The object reactivated is presumably not the same as the original for a couple of reasons. The first is obvious: the object has lost its context, its unique place in space and time, its physical history, which has been replaced by distance.

## Fantasy

> It isn’t that I want something I am being deprived of. I don’t know what I want until I have been deprived of it. Fantasy covers over a gap and a gap is a distance, however small. […] Still, we need to remember that “Authentic Mexican Style” only works if I’m trying to experience flavors from (1) somewhere I’ve never been (a geographical gap) or (2) a place I’ve left and maybe miss (a temporal gap). In this sense, fantasy only ever works at the level of good enough right now and is never equal to the original.

## Copy Implies Original

> But there’s a second sense in which the reactivated object is different. Benjamin claims that the “presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity”—though really, isn’t it true that there’s no question of the original *until there is a copy*? Until there are differences against which to measure (carbon dating, brush strokes, whatever)? The copy is what instantiates the original *as original*. The copy injects authenticity, or even invents it through differences.
>
> In any case, there may not even need to be an original object for the authentic to register. This is how I read Ellis’s recent description of what he calls the “science fiction condition,” how “we can measure the contemporary day by the things that have become absent. Things we perhaps only notice peripherally.” I like this idea of measuring change by the removal or absence or invisibility of things. And maybe these things never even have to exist to register as absent? Nostalgia works that way by suggesting we’re missing something now we likely never had then. And maybe the best way to sell an authentic future is to remove something we don’t notice now, so that an authentic-seeming future wouldn’t be drawn as us with the addition of jet packs, but as us with the subtraction of a commute to work. The best way to show a future would maybe then be to open a space in the present and point to that vacancy as different from now.

## Authentic Future

> An Authentic Future could depend upon an amplification of certain traits of the present that would be more real that what we know, that would be hyper-real, super-real, or *surreal*. Ellis describes it in precisely these terms when discussing “the central problem” of science fiction, which “stands in a speculative zone from which to consider aspects of the present condition…. It needs…a piece of the future, of novelty, of something as yet unseen…. Faced with a line like ‘the door dilated,’ the brain has to do a little extra work to make it make contextual sense…. you accept the experience of processing strangeness and applying it to the world you know” (48). “Dilated” is a great and surprising word, but what renders the phrase strange is that the door didn’t “open.” *Dilated* is one of any number of words that could be placed over the absence of *opened*.

## Performing Authenticity

> Authenticity is a performance, and so we have at least two options:

1. one nested in the past in order to maintain a fantasy of completeness by imagining a future that has already happened, or
1. as Shaviro argues, “a stealth future, very different from the one of jet packs and flying cars, but in a way much more radical – precisely because it happens before we are fully able to take notice.”

> This last is an insistence that we live in the future now in terms of what we don't notice, even in terms of what uses us. And we can only respond with what we have and hack it.
