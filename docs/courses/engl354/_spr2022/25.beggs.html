# Alex Beggs, "Diet Foods of the '80s Are Out. But Has Anything Really Changed?"

class: f29px
## Irony

> “I’m like everybody else,” says ConAgra CEO Mike Harper as he walks into a private airplane hangar. “I lead a busy life.” In the 1989 commercial Harper tells the camera that after he had a heart attack he couldn’t find “healthy food that was really great-tasting.” So he invented Healthy Choice. Cut to a glamour shot of the low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol frozen dinners: a sectioned oval tray with gravy-covered sirloin tips, a side of baby carrots, potatoes, and a fruit-topped dessert. By the end of the spot, Harper is piloting his little blue propeller plane off the runway.

## Definition

> In the three years following that ad, Healthy Choice would rake in $1 billion in sales. And it was hardly alone. Lean Cuisine, Diet Coke, Crystal Light, Bud Light: Diet food became a juggernaut in the 1980s thanks to a winning combo of government influence, food tech, and good old-fashioned societal pressure to be thin. And in the years following, the industry would only grow. We don’t like to call it diet food anymore, but in 2020 foods with a dietary claim made over $100 billion.

## Why?

> From the moment in 1898 when J.H. Kellogg introduced Toasted Corn Flakes to get our digestion on track and help stave off the urge to “self-pollute” (masturbate), we’ve looked to food to make us healthier, more virtuous, and, yes, thinner. Has it worked? Not really. So why do we keep expecting it to?

## Counterargument

> And yet! There was no evidence that low-fat Kraft Singles advertised on television by a young Leo DiCaprio made us thinner or healthier. Meanwhile, obesity rates in America shot up for the first time in the ’80s. Chicken McNuggets made their debut. By 1988 fast-food sales had increased to $60 billion (up from $6 billion in 1970). Portion sizes for what constituted a single serving sharply increased. President Reagan restricted food-stamp eligibility, making it harder for low-income Americans to get affordable fresh food. The health care system became increasingly privatized and Medicaid spending was cut, widening the health disparities between the rich and the poor. My mom—a nurse—was drinking cold Pepsi after cold Pepsi and also smoking Marlboro reds while she was pregnant with me. What I’m saying is: There were other things going on in this country that affected American health more than the food on grocery store shelves.

## Word Choice

> But back to Healthy Choice. The year the brand was founded, 1989, 626 new “reduced-fat” products were introduced, up 127 percent from the previous year. Healthy Choice stood out because it wasn’t marketed as a weight-loss solution the way Weight Watchers’ frozen dinners were. The focus was on “healthy.” “Listen to your heart,” was the slogan slathered on ads showing svelte grandpas flexing for their grandkids and thin couples canoodling. The ads compared Healthy Choice’s fat, sodium, and cholesterol counts to other brands and “reaffirmed notions that health is a personal choice, a lifestyle choice, and that health concerns should be addressed through commodity solutions,” writes S. Bryn Austin in her essay for the book Weighty Issues. In other words: Skip the doctor, head to Safeway! And that mindset has everything to do with where the diet food industry is today.

## Definition

> For the first time since it started tracking the diet industry, the market research firm Datamonitor saw a decline in new products with the word diet in the brand name starting in 2005. That same year Coke launched Coke Zero, which is a diet soda like all that came before it but largely marketed to men, as scholar Emily J.H. Contois explains in her book *Diners, Dudes, and Diets*. The word diet was too intertwined with women’s deprivation diets, which were historically huge bummers, while the word zero implied a lack of bullshit.

## Definition Again

> In the food industry but also in skin care, fashion, fitness, and beyond, the concept of “self-care” cozily slipped in where “health” once reigned. Wellness wraps up food, mental health, and self-love into one beautifully designed package that can try to disentangle itself from the diet industry but can never quite escape one thing: our body obsession.

## Section "Path to *Purity*"

> In 2006 Michael Pollan’s seminal book, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, argued that local organic food is good and so-called processed food is bad, very generally speaking. The book explores the ethical, planetary, and cultural cost of industrialized food and was a huge best seller, racking up accolades and even a young readers’ version. It’s arguably shaping a generation of eaters, including farmers-market-loving me. In much of his work, Pollan “sets up a moral hierarchy of food,” writes dietitian Christy Harrison in her book Anti-Diet, and it gave some readers even more food anxiety than we already had. Though hardly the first to do so (see Kellogg and masturbation), his influence, along with the seemingly uncontainable wellness industry, has given us another layer under which to cloak diet culture.
---
## Purity

> In her book, Harrison writes about how the wellness industry seems to be selling overall health, but it can’t exist without making you fear being unhealthy, which most Americans still associate with fatness. The diet culture lurking in food activists like Pollan’s work, she explains, is the underlying idea that the wrong foods will make you fat and that fatness is a national shame. Eating more sustainably farmed food is great and all, but if you’re eating out of self-loathing, fear, and hatred of being fat, it’s still diet culture. […]
>
> In *Diners, Dudes, and Diets*, Contois posits that the wellness industry really took off during and after the chaos of the 2016 presidential election. When the world outside feels out of control, people seek control over the closest thing in the vicinity: their bodies. The Wellness Diet, Harrison writes in *Anti-Diet*, “is a type of virtue signaling that people use to secure and maintain their own class status.” The pandemic only magnified the problem. Sales of sleep-aid teas, calming chocolates, and anything labeled “immune-boosting” skyrocketed. We’re in such a crowded mess of new diet foods that it’s funny to me that the most popular diet last year was old-fashioned deprivation rebranded as intermittent fasting.

## Anxiety

> “To become a national way of life, weight control had to be built into the culture as if it had always been there,” writes historian Hillel Schwartz in *Never Satisfied: A Cultural History of Diets, Fantasies and Fat*. “Diet food had to seem to be basic food.” Prebiotic sodas, bags of LesserEvil avocado-oil air-popped popcorn (love the stuff ), all seem like snacks to me at this point, but something deep down, or not so deep down anymore, knows they’re tugging at my anxiety over eating my one true love: kettle chips.
