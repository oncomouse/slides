    ## Bizzell's Historiography
    
    > It is important to remember that what we inherit as the "rhetorical tradition," for blessing or curse, comprises at least three modalities: texts deemed worthy of rhetorical study, methods of analyzing those texts, and methods of teaching rhetoric according to precepts and principles derived from those texts. Such a description of our cultural legacy would seem to put texts at the center of the tradition, and indeed, anthologies focus our attention on the rhetorical tradition as a set of texts. **(109)**

    ## Legacy of the Canon
    
    > Although the tradition appears to be text-based, how we wish to analyze verbal productions and how we prefer to teach the art of producing them govern our choices of rhetorical texts to preserve, elevate, or delete. And modern histories of rhetoric have shown that the preferences governing these choices arise out of complex cultural factors relating to gender, race, social class, national identity, and more. **(Bizzell 110)**

    ## Contemporary Needs Drive Canon
    > Therefore, they received little attention until recent revaluations moved them more into the mainstream of the acknowledged rhetorical tradition. The best examples of this category are the Sophists; indeed, interest in them continues to burgeon, and we increased our coverage of the Sophists in our second edition. Perhaps this interest arises in part from their chronological and cultural proximity to the traditional ancient Greek "blue chips," but I think it must also be attributed in part to the Sophists' focus on the human element in knowledge-making, which has loomed increasingly large to intellectual historians and theorists in many disciplines engulfed in the present rhetorical turn. **(Bizzell 112)**

    ## Stated More Simply

    ## New Traditions
    
    > Scholars with some different cultural assumptions and interests than those of privileged white men had to gain access to the textual record of human civilization, looking it over for texts that could be adapted to these different scholars' agenda. **(Bizzell 114)**

    > We included no texts in which the authors merely demonstrated rhetoric, but only texts in which they talked about language use in these metacritical ways. In other words, we chose writers who were all, in some sense, theorists of rhetoric. **(Bizzell 115)**

    ## The Problem
    
    > The Poulakos/Schiappa, Black Athena,and Knoblauch and Brannon debates raise questions of how the past and its uses presently legitimate(intentionally or not) knowledges that perpetuate unequal acquisitions of authority and exercises of power. In all three of the cases listed above, historiographic concerns about the articulation of ancient Greece within contemporary North America become debates about whether and how historically to situate hegemonic authority in classical and modern geographic locations. **(Marback 78)**
    
    .topic[History or Myth of Rhetoric]

    class: big, middle
    
    ## The Stakes
    
    > The prospects of postcolonial historicizing of rhetoric lie in acts of reading rhetoric and its history as effects of cultural, institutional, and theoretical discourses that organize our disciplinary knowledge of the past in relation to current distributions and exercises of power. At the same time, the perils of theorizing history of rhetoric and the rhetoric of historiography as discursive effects lie in too quickly claiming escape from a colonizing past and in too easily denying complicity in a colonized present. **(Marback 79)**

    ## Realist vs Social Construction (Bitzer vs Vatz, again)
    
    > ... historical uses of the past are uses that attempt, as far as possible, to understand ancient texts, such as those of the first sophists, in their own terms. Schiappa's opponents immediately attack his claims for historical reconstruction by highlighting the impossibility of completely disentangling historical from theoretical uses of ancient texts. **(Marback 81)**
