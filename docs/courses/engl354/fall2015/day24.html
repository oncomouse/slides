    > Chaos theory was developed in opposition to Newton's mechanical physics and examines situations that cannot be conceptualized (schematized) due to the lack of information. Complexity theory examines situations that emerge between the polarity of chance and order where "self-organizing systems emerge to create new patterns of coherence and structures of relation" (24).

    > The ancient civic space that led to the emergence of rhetoric has been replaced by contemporary network space. In its place, however, are few rhetorical theories that adequately address the complexities of this new social space. Simply applying rhetorical systems developed in the context of ancient Greece to our contemporary period seems to fall into the desire for simplicity that Taylor hopes to counter. (831-832)

    > If rhetoric and composition is to move forward and adapt to the coming networked cultures, it can no longer settle, much less strive for, the production of overly simple systems to account for the complexity of writing. The investigation of works like Taylor's, as I have tried to show, could push re-theorizations of writing and rhetoric forward toward the coming global media culture. (846)

    > a schema (like the notion of a grid itself) is caught up in complex networks that evolve and adapt to new circumstances. This basic process has implications for rhetorical heuristics: (1) students need to develop their own schemata to fit their particular topics/situations, and (2) if we give them schemata first, their goal should be to revise those schemata as a part of the invention process rather than follow them prescriptively.

    > Bitzer presupposes a causal chain from reality to speaker to text to audience to reality, positing the initial exigence as the origin of the causal chain. Vatz, she argues, simply starts the chain with the speaker who through interpretation of an exigence puts his intention into the situation via discourse.

    > Biesecker is after emergence and is using the Derridian lexicon to find an articulation of it. She comes close to the notion of emergence but doesn't move all the way to something like complex adaptive systems. Environment, rhetoric, texts, and audiences are complex adaptive systems in themselves and together form other complex adaptive systems. What we have are networks linked to other networks. Complexity theory can give us a new set of terms beyond the notion of differance [sic] through which we can understand and articulate the complexity of rhetorical situations, especially in a complex media-rich environment where so many events are co produced through media.

    > Again, I think complexity theory can give us a language that articulates the two apparently incompatible conceptions of kairos—one that favors the rhetor and one the situation—within a single system. Seizing the moment means being able to anticipate it, unconsciously as well as consciously, not just reacting to it but adapting to it, with it, and often times quickly. We may never be able to completely predict complex behavior, only recognize elements of it in retrospect, but being able to recognize more of it as it is developing and to understand how we might co-adapt along with it will become a vital rhetorical skill.

    > Logos is a very complex term. G.B. Kerford notes that the term caries at least three levels of meaning which refer to three different applications or uses: language (speech, discourse, argument, description, statement; thought), mental processes (thinking, reasoning accounting for, explanation); and world (structural principles, formula, natural laws, which "are regarded as actually present in and exhibited in the world-process") (83). In other words, the term implies the larger complex in which bodies, texts, and thought are always connected. Kerford warns that whenever we see the term in the pre-Socratics, Aristotle, or the sophists, it always carries elements of all three meanings.  (840)

    > Our contemporary period signals the subject's absence. The image of a single, central, stable subject gives way to a multiplicity of selves. This goes beyond Aristotle's custom, or dramatis personae, to the multiplicity of relations we establish. In a media culture this distinction is vital. It is not simply the identity we might try out online but the relationships established through those identities and the affects of those relationships on bodies. (842)

    > Taylor explicitly makes these connections, arguing that the writer as screen operates in a polarity with the situation and in an economy of personal experience, texts that are read, and words that are written. In this context, the writer reaches evolutionary roadblocks (schemata no longer fit the circum stances, forms are no longer relevant). These evolutionary dead ends change schemata, which changes possible relationships, and thereby affects the larger evolutionary development. (844)

    > Like ants, writers are a "colony of writers" caught up in the larger evolutionary flows of other networks. In short, "[t]he moment of writing is a moment of complexity" (198). And for Taylor, we write to produce and embody these moments in order to contribute to the evolution of thought/schemata and thus the whole (cultural) ecology. Our writing should disturb, create more noise, push equilibrium into new relations and assemblages (845).
