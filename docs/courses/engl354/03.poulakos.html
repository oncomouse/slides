    ## Rhetorical Problems
    
    > we are still bound to the directives of Plato's System of Idealism and Aristotle's System of Development. But because rhetoric came about as an activity grounded in human experience, not in philosophical reflection, we must approach it by looking at those who practiced it before turning to those who reflected about it. (35)

    ## New Definition of Rhetoric
    
    > The definition I wish to advance is: *Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible*. Very briefly, this definition intimâtes that rhetoric is an artistic undertaking which concerns itself with the how, the when, and the what of expression and understands the why of purpose. Further, this definition links rhetoric to a movement originating in the sphere of actuality and striving to attain a place in that of potentiality. (36)
    ---
    ## Art?
    
    > The Sophists conceived of rhetoric primarily as a *techne* (art) whose medium is logos and whose double aim is *terpsis* (aesthetic pleasure) and *pistis* (belief). (36)
    
    > Conceiving of rhetoric as art is important because on the one hand it designates the sophistic view proper and on the other it helps piace the controversy between Plato and the Sophists in the right light. In particular, one may argue, rhetoric as art does not admit criteria appropriate to strictly epistemological or axiological matters; nor does it cali for the same considerations which rhetoric as argument does. Thus, some of the well-known Platonic charges against rhetoric become inapplicable.11 In distinction to episteme, rhetoric does not strive for cognitive certitude, the affirmation of logic, or the articulation of universals. Conditioned by the people who create it, rhetoric moves beyond the domain of logic and, satisfied with probability, lends itself to the flexibility of the contingent. (37)

    ## The Role of Style
    
    > As the historical record indicates, the Sophists were master rhetoricians. That their excellence in the area of style has often been construed as a liability is due partly to Plato's influence on posterity and partly to the excesses of some of their successors. But if it is agreed that what is said must be said somehow, and that the how is a matter of the speaker's choice, then style betrays the speaker's unique grasp of language and becomes the peculiar expression of his personality. If this is so, the Sophists need no longer be misunderstood. As some of their artifacts reveal, they were highly accomplished linguistic craftsmen with a heightened sense of the nature of *logo*, their medium. (38)

    ## A Practical Art
    
    > The sophistic insistence that speaking be done with respect to time does not stem from a philosophical position regarding the nature of *logos* but from the observation that if what is said is timely, its timeliness renders it more sensible, more rightful, and ultimately more persuasive. (40)

    ## Keywords for Sophistic Rhetoric
    
    1. *kairos* (timing)
    1. *to prepon* (appropriateness)
    1. *to dynaton* (possibility)
    ---
    class: big
    ## *Kairos*
    
    >  For the most part, what compels a rhetor to speak is a sense of urgency. Under normal circumstances, that is, under circumstances in which we are composed and things are "under control," there is no pressing need to speak. But during times of stress, we feel compelled to intervene and, with the power of the word, to attempt to end a crisis, redistribute justice, or restore order (39)
    
    >  Clearly, speaking involves a temporal choice. The choice is not whether to speak but whether to speak now; more precisely, it is  whether now is the time to speak. (39-40)

    ## Practice not Reflection
    
    >  The sophistic insistence that speaking be done with respect to time does not stem from a philosophical position regarding the nature of logos but from the observation that if what is said is timely, its timeliness renders it more sensible, more rightful, and ultimately more persuasive. (40)
    ---
    ## *To prepon*
    
    >  A complement to the notion of kairos, to prepon points out that situations have formal characteristics, and demands that speaking as a response to a situation be suitable to those very characteristics. Both notions are concerned with the rhetor's response; but while the former is interested in the when, the latter is concerned with the what of speaking. To prepon requires that speech must take into account and be guided by the formal structure of the situation it addresses. (41)

    ## Sophistic Method
    
    > At least one of them, Gorgias, asserted that situations have a way of revealing themselves to man and eliciting respones from him. (38-9)
    
    > Both timeliness and appropriateness are rhetorical motifs whose essence cannot be apprehended strictly cognitively and whose application cannot be learnt mechanically. (42)
    
    > If persuasion is to occur, both qualities must be present in the spoken word. In short, the right thing must be said at the right time; inversely, the right time becomes apparent precisely because the right thing has been spoken. (42)

    ## *To prepon*: Desire for the Possible
    
    > The starting point for the articulation of the possible is the ontological assumption that the main driving forces in man's life are his desires, especially the desire to be other and to be elsewhere. Another relevant assumption is that the sphere of actuality always entails a lack, the absence of that which exists only in the future; more particularly, that actuality frustrâtes man when he dreams of being other and binds him to where he already is when he wants to be elsewhere. (42-3)

    ## That Which is Not
    
    > is is where the rhetorician steps in and helps him resolve his existential dilemma. By exploiting people's proclivity to perceive themselves in the future and their readiness to thrust themselves into unknown regions, the rhetorician tells them what they could be, brings out in them futuristic versions of themselves, and sets before them both goals and the directions which lead to those goals. Ali this he does by creating and presenting to them that which has the potential to be, but is not. Thus it is no paradox to say that rhetoric strives to create and labors to put forth, to propose that which is not. (43)

    ## Rhetorical Choice
    
    > Should they fail, they ought to adopt what he says; should they succeed, they hâve grounds on which to reject what he advocates. In the former case, the possible is well on its way to actuality; but even in the latter, it has served a useful function: it has provided the challenge in response to which the listeners have reexamined their actual situation. That they may decide to affirm their previously held views is not that important. What is more important is that by doing so they hâve moved from accepting actuality uncritically, as it is and because it is, to accepting it deliberately, because it has withstood the challenge of a possible (46).

    ## Conclusion
    
    * Three new rhetorical terms:
    	* *kairos* – the right time
    	* *to prepon* – the proper
    	* *to dynaton* – the possible
    * Start Reading *Gorgias* for Monday</textarea>
