            <p>First, though, a little about me. I teach in English in the College of Letters and Sciences at the ASU Polytechnic campus. My background is in a field called rhetoric, which is the study of persuasive discourse and the historical usage of communication to affect change in the world. Specifically, I study the ways in which digital technologies change the nature of discourse and how these changes in our communications change who we are and how we think. Basically, I'm interested in the way that digital technologies are remaking us as people and even what it means to be alive.</p>

Traceroute is a command used to debug network connectivity and it returns all the hubs (called routers) through which a packet of information is shipped between the user's home computer (192.168.1.1 in the above example) to Netflix's streaming video server with the IP address of 108.175.39.182.

            <blockquote>
              <p>As a user who already suffers slow internet due to geography and income, I say that keeping the internet an equal opportunity environment is essential to the proliferation of the thing itself. If some users benefit from a change that causes many to suffer then it is a step in the wrong direction. It would be easy to say that this proposal is a shameless grab for wealth and power, but I choose to say what is difficult: there is a critical moment coming; one that will be of vital importance to the human race for all time to come, and there are individuals in a position to raise up humanity to a height inconceivable. However, those individuals are also in a position to drive a wedge between themselves and the remainder of humanity permanently, not unlike the morlocks of Wells' dystopia. Choose the righteous path. Choose the path that leads to a strong, unified humankind. Thank you.</p>
