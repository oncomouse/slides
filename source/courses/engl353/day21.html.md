# Desiderius Erasmus <br> *De Copia*
---
## Discussion Leader (Meghan)

> The first and simplest form of variation depends on using different words which indicate the same thing, so that as far as meaning goes it does not matter which you prefer to employ. The grammarians call these synonyms. Opposite to these are words called homonyms. These two types have also been called equivocal and univocal, although according to the logicians these terms are more applicable to the things signified than to the signifying words.

Consider the first sentence of this passage. Do you think that Erasmus is right that forcing the use of many different synonyms improves your writing? Often different synonyms carry different connotations, and could change the way your audience receives your message. Do you think diversifying your language to sound more eloquent at the cost of potentially being misunderstood is worth it?

## Discussion Leader (Gabriella)

> The purpose of these instructions is to enable you so to include the essentials in the fewest possible words that nothing is lacking, or so to enlarge and enrich your expression of it that even so nothing is redundant. (301)

Though Erasmus states that his purpose is to enable the reader to use both, he tends to emphasize the enlargement and enrichment of expression rather than brevity. Why does he prefer the prior to the latter and what implications does this have on clarity?

## Purpose For Writing

> They pile up a meaningless heap of words and expressions without any discrimination, and thus obscure the subject they are talking about, as well as belaboring the ears of their unfortunate audience. In fact, quite a few persons of no real education or understanding have, heaven help us, undertaken to give instruction in this very subject, and these, wile professing mastery of *copia*, have merely revealed their own total lack of it.
>
> Such considerations have induced me to put forward some ideas on *copia*, the abundant style, myself, treating its two aspects of content and expression, and giving some examples and patterns.  (I.i)
---
## The Place of Style

> One of my reasons for is that I have undertaken this task solely out of a desire to be helpful, so I shall be quite content for another to reap the glory, so long as I am ultimately responsible for some benefit reaching the students. Also I am committed to more serious studies which prevent me from expending a great deal of labor on topics which, in spite of their considerable contribution to serious subjects, themselves seem unimportant. (I.i)

> If in these circumstances we find ourselves destitute of verbal riches and hesitate, or keep singing out the same old phrase like a cuckoo, and are unable to clothe our thought in other colors or other forms, we shall look ridiculous when we show ourselves to be tongue-tied. (I.viii)

> Nature above all delights in variety; in all this huge concourse of things, she has left nothing anywhere unpainted by her wonderful technique of variety. (I.viii)
---
## Why Do This?

> The first method on enriching what one has to say on a subject is to take something that can be expressed in brief and general terms, and expand it and separate it into its constituent parts. This is just like displaying some object for sale first of all through a grill or inside a wrapping, and then unwrapping it and opening it out and displaying it fully to the gaze.
>
> Here is an example of the method. Let us take the sentence: *He wasted all his substance in riotous living*. THis is expressed in summary fashion, and is, so to speak, wrapped up. We can open it up by enumerating all the different type sof possessions and setting out the various ways of wasting them: ... (II. Method 1)

## Roots in Tradition

> Now in case anyone should feel inclined to despise it as some newfangled discovery recently brought into the world within the four walls of my own study, I would have him know that this whole idea of being able to express one's meaning in a variety of ways is in a number of places touched on by that learned and thorough writer Quintilian, further, that a number of famous sophists blazed a trail, showing how to compress and abridge what was being said, and this they could not have done without at the same time demonstrating how to expand it. (I.ii)
---
## Humor

> If we are afraid that the antiquity or novelty of our word may offend the ears of our audience, the best thing will be to take Quintilian's advice and remember to forestall criticism by commenting on the word ourselves. Here are some sample ways of doing this: Cato, a glutton for books ...
>
>*Vulgar words*
>
> Vulgar words are those which will strike the hearer as rather too common for the dignity of the context, like calling one's familiar friend one's "old hearty," or an avid reader "a glutton for literature" (I.xi)
---
## "Practical" Demonstration

Let us, for example, take this sentence: "Your letter pleased me mightily"

> *your*: There is no synonym for "your," but a periphrasis is possible: Your excellency's, your highness's, your majesty's. If we insert a proper name such as "Faustus" and say "Faustus's letter," we employ two forms of heterosis, the substitution of a noun for a pronoun and of a third person for a second. If we say "Faustine letters," using a derivative adjective instead of the genitive of the noun, that is yet another form of heterosis.
>
> *letter*: epistle, letter, note (synonym); epistolet, letterette, notelet (heterosis); pages, lines (synecdoche); what you wrote to me (periphrasis).
>
> *pleased*: delighted, refreshed, exhilarated (synonyms, though "exhilarated" is better considered a metaphor); brought pleasure, were a pleasure, were delightful (these and similar expressions illustrate periphrasis); bathed in delight, were honey-sweet, and so on (transferred or metaphorical expressions); were not unwelcome, not unpleasing (these result from the interchange of opposites). (I.xxxiii)

## Placing Words

> There are many things for which the poets use one set of words, orators another. There are also words peculiar to different ages and centuries, and even the same authors often express the same thing by different means. So the first thing is to extract the best words one can from every type of writer, and whatever they are like, add them to the collection. No word is to be rejected, provided it occurs in an author who is at all respectable, for there is no word which would not be best one in some place or other. So however vulgar, unusual, poetic, archaic, novel, obsolete, harsh, barbarous, or foreign it may be, lay it up in its proper niche with its fellows, so that you may summon it if ever a use for it arises. (I.xi)
---
## Commonplaces

> Generally speaking, arguments are derived from definition or defining formulae, from description, from exposition of the meaning of a word, which is a form of definition, or from things which definition by its very nature includes: genus, species, properties, differentiating characteristics, subdivision, classification (this last takes various forms, for example, a consideration of aspects such as commencement, completion, development); or from deductions based on similar or dissimilar situations; from contraries, contradictions, consequences, related propositions, causes, results, comparisons ... and from self-evident statements ... Anyone training with a view to acquiring eloquence will have to look at all the possible topics in turn, go knocking from door to door so to speak, to see if anything can be induced to emerge; but with practice the right ones will come to suggest themselves naturally, without this process being necessary. (II. Method 11)
---
## Reading

> Having made up your mind to cover the whole field of literature in your reading (**and anyone who wishes to be educated must do this at least once in his life**), first provide yourself with a full list of subjects. These will consist partly of the main types and subdivisions of vice and virtue, partly of the things of most prominence in human affairs which frequently occur when we have a case to put forward, and they should be arranged according to similars and opposites ...
>
> Topics that do not come under the head of vices and virtues belong partly to "examples," partly to "commonplaces"  (II. Assembling Materials)
---
## Reading for Abundance

> So prepare for yourself a sufficient number of headings, and arrange them as you please, subdivide them into the appropriate sections, and under each section add your commonplaces and maxims; and then whatever you come across in any author, particularly if it is rather striking, you will be able to note down immediately in the proper place, be it an anecdote or a fable or an illustrative example or a strange incident or a maxim or a witty remark or a remark notable for some other quality or a proverb or a metaphor or a simile.
>
> This has the double advantage of fixing what you have read more firmly in your mind, and getting you into the habit of using the riches supplied by your reading. Some people have much material stored up so to speak in their vaults, but when it comes to speaking or writing they are remarkably ill-supplied or impoverished. A third result is that whatever the occasion demands, you will have the materials for a speech ready to hand, as you have all the pigeonholes duly arranged so that you can extract just what you want from them. (II. Assembling Materials)

## Variety of Variety

> It is not enough to provide oneself with an enormous and very varied supply of illustrations, and to have them ready for use at a moment's notice; one must also be able to handle them with variety. Variety can be provided by the very nature of the illustrative examples themselves. They can be things done or said in the past, or be derived from the customs of various nations. There will be differences according to whether they are drawn from historians, or from poets ..., or from philosophers..., or from the theologians, or the books of the Bible ... (II. Method II)
