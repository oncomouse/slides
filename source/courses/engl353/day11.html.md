# Aristotle, *Rhetoric*
]
---
## Discussion Leader (Jason)

> Rhetoric is useful (1) because things that are true and things that are just have a natural tendency to prevail over their opposites, so that if the decisions of judges are not what they ought to be, the defeat must be due to the speakers themselves, and they must be blamed accordingly. (I.i, 1355a)

What are the unique elements of rhetoric that affords it status as arbitrator of the true and the just? And, further, does this status heighten the role of rhetoric in philosophical discussion or compromise it?

## Discussion Leader (Blake)

> "The end of democracy is freedom" (I.viii)
> 
> "rhetorical persuasion is effected not only by demonstrative but by ethical argument; it helps a speaker to convince us, if we believe that he has certain qualities himself, namely, goodness, or goodwill towards us, or both together." (I.viii)

If a candidate for presidency must convince the people both that he has the end goal of freedom in mind and that he is a good/virtuous person then what should voters look for in candidates

## Aristotle's Surviving Work

* Around 30 of probably 200 works
* Wrote numerous dialogues, which are all lost
* Remaining works are **treatises**
	* Probably not intended for publication
	* Lecture notes, essentially
* Wide-range of topics
* Formed groundwork for much of Western knowledge
	* Several scientific theses lasted until 19th century

## From Platonism to Empiricism

* Believes in the forms
* Human experience is only tool for knowledge
* Categorization of experiences into types
	* Natural philosophy (science)
	* Arts (poetry, drama, etc)
	* Becomes a problem for rhetoric
* Dialectic is a tool for verifying experience

## Departure From Plato

> Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic. Both alike are concerned with such things as come, more or less, within the general ken of all men and belong to no definite science. Accordingly all men make use, more or less, of both; for to a certain extent all men attempt to discuss statements and to maintain them, to defend themselves and to attack others. Ordinary people do this either at random or through practice and from acquired habit. Both ways being possible, the subject can plainly be handled systematically, for it is possible to inquire the reason why some speakers succeed through practice and others spontaneously; and every one will at once agree that such an inquiry is the function of an art. (I.i, 1354a)

## What He's Doing

> Now, the framers of the current treatises on rhetoric have constructed but a small portion of that art. The modes of persuasion are the only true constituents of the art: everything else is merely accessory. These writers, however, say nothing about enthymemes, which are the substance of rhetorical persuasion, but deal mainly with non-essentials. (I.i, 1354a)

## Enthymeme?

1. Originally meant a clever saying, witticism, or paradox
1. Aristotle means it to be a publicly spoken, informal syllogism
1. Well, what's a syllogism?
	1. Deductive argument
	1. Series of propositions that, when taken together, prove a conclusion
	1. All men are mortal <br> Socrates is a man <br> Therefore, Socrates is mortal
1. Enthymeme do not necessarily have a formal structure
1. Task of orator:
	1. Match propositions to audience
	1. Prove conclusion from these propositions
---
## Orators Demonstrate Enthymeme

> It is clear, then, that rhetorical study, in its strict sense, is concerned with the modes of persuasion. Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. The orator's demonstration is an enthymeme, and this is, in general, the most effective of the modes of persuasion. The enthymeme is a sort of syllogism, and the consideration of syllogisms of all kinds, without distinction, is the business of dialectic, either of dialectic as a whole or of one of its branches. It follows plainly, therefore, that he who is best able to see how and from what elements a syllogism is produced will also be best skilled in the enthymeme, when he has further learnt what its subject-matter is and in what respects it differs from the syllogism of strict logic. The true and the approximately true are apprehended by the same faculty; it may also be noted that men have a sufficient natural instinct for what is true, and usually do arrive at the truth. (I.i, 1355a)
---
## Non-essentials

> The arousing of prejudice, pity, anger, and similar emotions has nothing to do with the essential facts, but is merely a personal appeal to the man who is judging the case. (I.i, 1354a)

> If this is so, it is evident that any one who lays down rules about other matters, such as what must be the contents of the "introduction" or the "narration" or any of the other divisions of a speech, is theorizing about non-essentials as if they belonged to the art. The only question with which these writers here deal is how to put the judge into a given frame of mind. About the orator's proper modes of persuasion they have nothing to tell us; nothing, that is, about how to gain skill in enthymemes. (I.i, 1354b)

## Aristotle's Three Appeals

1. *ethos*
1. *pathos*
1. *logos*
---
## Why Can He Deemphasize Ethos & Pathos?

> Further, (3) we must be able to employ persuasion, just as strict reasoning can be employed, on opposite sides of a question, not in order that we may in practice employ it in both ways (for we must not make people believe what is wrong), but in order that we may see clearly what the facts are, and that, if another man argues unfairly, we on our part may be able to confute him. No other of the arts draws opposite conclusions: dialectic and rhetoric alone do this. Both these arts draw opposite conclusions impartially. Nevertheless, the underlying facts do not lend themselves equally well to the contrary views. No; things that are true and things that are better are, by their nature, practically always easier to prove and easier to believe in. (I.i, 1355a)

## Other Famous Definition

> Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion. This is not a function of any other art. Every other art can instruct or persuade about its own particular subject-matter; for instance, medicine about what is healthy and unhealthy, geometry about the properties of magnitudes, arithmetic about numbers, and the same is true of the other arts and sciences. But rhetoric we look upon as the power of observing the means of persuasion on almost any subject presented to us; and that is why we say that, in its technical character, it is not concerned with any special or definite class of subjects.(I.ii, 1355b)

## Watch the Audience

> A statement is persuasive and credible either because it is directly self-evident or because it appears to be proved from other statements that are so. In either case it is persuasive because there is somebody whom it persuades. (I.ii, 1356b)

## The Three Species

> Rhetoric falls into three divisions, determined by the three classes of listeners to speeches. For of the three elements in speech-making – speaker, subject, and person addressed – it is the last one, the hearer, that determines the speech's end and object. The hearer must be either a judge, with a decision to make about things past or future, or an observer. A member of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are observers. From this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory-(1) political, (2) forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display. (I.iii, 1358a-b)
---
## Moral Matters

> First, then, we must ascertain what are the kinds of things, good or bad, about which the political orator offers counsel. For he does not deal with all things, but only with such as may or may not take place. Concerning things which exist or will exist inevitably, or which cannot possibly exist or take place, no counsel can be given. Nor, again, can counsel be given about the whole class of things which may or may not take place; for this class includes some good things that occur naturally, and some that occur by accident; and about these it is useless to offer counsel. Clearly counsel can only be given on matters about which people deliberate; matters, namely, that ultimately depend on ourselves, and which we have it in our power to set going.(I.iv, 1358b)

## The Good

> It may be said that every individual man and all men in common aim at a certain end which determines what they choose and what they avoid. This end, to sum it up briefly, is happiness and its constituents. Let us, then, by way of illustration only, ascertain what is in general the nature of happiness, and what are the elements of its constituent parts. For all advice to do things or not to do them is concerned with happiness and with the things that make for or against it; whatever creates or increases happiness or some part of happiness, we ought to do; whatever destroys or hampers happiness, or gives rise to its opposite, we ought not to do. (I.v, 1360b)
