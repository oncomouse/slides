## <small>Origins</small> Where I Stand

1. Dispute: "can we call something prior to the origin of the term 'rhetoric?'"

	* But: I've reviewed the literature
	* Considered the two positions
	* Made my choice
	* Open to change

## <small>Egypt</small> Early Public Speaking

1. Egypt has a long history of largely uninterrupted cultural stability
1. Developed a system of public speaking based on hierarchy
1. Conservative in nature rather than innovative
1. Earlier along the oral/literate split

## <small>Egypt</small> Oral/Literate Split

> Assuming the context of a largely non-literate culture, we can postulate that both pieces were presented to audiences less "literate" than the speaker. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed to be delivered orally. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed, in large part, during the initial presentation and only later written down in full ... what survives of Parmenides and Gorgias represents a strange case of "literate" discourse presented to a preponderantly "illiterate" audience.
>
> -- Jan Swearingen, "Literate Rhetors and their Illiterate Audiences; the Orality of Early Literacy," 147-9

## <small>Egypt</small> Magic and Creation

> One  such  belief  that  becomes  evident  is  the  conception among the Egyptians that language has magical power, at least  in  a  religious  context.  Among  the  various  creation myths that can be found in Egyptian religion is one that is particularly striking from a linguistic point of view. This myth  presents  the  creation  of  the  world  by  means  of speech (evolving a comparison with creation in the book of Genesis). According to the Egyptian myth, from Memphis in the Old Kingdom, “It is Ptah, the very great, who has given life to all the gods and their *kas*, through this heart and through this tongue” (Lichtheim, p. 54). In this myth, the power of thought and speech provides the act of  creation. (Hutto 4)

## <small>Egypt</small> Magic and Naming

> The Egyptian attitude toward the power of words found a very interesting expression in a belief in the secret power of names [...] An expression of this belief in the power of names was the idea that the ability to name a thing provided a source of power over that thing. From both the Old and Middle kingdoms there are references to such a belief. In a religious variant, we find the story of how the goddess Isis acquired equal power with the supreme solar god Ra by tricking him into telling her his name. (Hutto 4)
