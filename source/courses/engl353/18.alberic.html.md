# Alberic of Monte Cassino <br> *The Flowers of Rhetoric*
---
## Discussion Leader (Rebecca)

> There you have the simple style, making the point clearly, without any embellishment at all, using clarity as its only decoration.

> But why say any more? All books (books that are worth while, I mean) abound in this kind of device. So study this sort of thing very diligently; after studying it, practice it; as you practice, learn to keep a tight rein on it—a tight rein, so that it does not take over control of what you are writing, with the result that the ensuing saturation of imagery engenders its own boredom in the hearts of readers.

Question: In classical rhetoric, we discussed how florid rhetoric is psychologically seductive. Here, Alberic suggests that this is not necessarily true. Do you agree that there can be beauty in simplicity of style and dryness in flamboyance?

## Walter Ong on Letter Writing

> …in the West through the Middle Ages and earlier almost all those devoted to writing regularly used the services of a scribe because the physical labour writing involved—scraping and polishing the animal skin or parchment, whitening it with chalk, resharpening goose-quill pens with what we still call a penknife, mixing ink, and all the rest—interfered with thought and composition. (Ong 30)

## Violent Metaphors

> Until now we have rehearsed our hearers in the preliminary training of grammar; now that the period of practice is over, we must lead them to the battlefield of composition. After all, if we have omitted so much up to this point regarding the incredibly wide choice of words and regarding the appreciation of their melody as well, what else can we call our work but the milk of learning, the training of a child? Thus far we have looked at the rudiments of education; now we move into the full manly power of knowledge (132)

## Fruit Metaphors

> Therefore, let the sincere soul develop, let it eat and drink and grow from within, let flaws and triviality vanish, let the juices not be drawn too soon; at last, touched by the rod of Phoebus, the mind will bear fruit. Here Alberic soars high, expects to gain the palm of victory; now his adversary becomes silent, mute, agape, stunned with admiration; here integrity and dependability thrive. (132-133)

## Three Types of Histories

> There are three kinds of histories, as we know: there are those which deal with noble topics like wars and the acts of the gods, those which deal with the ordinary subjects like flowers and trees and the physical elements, and those which deal with such low themes as the games of youth and the dalliance of lovers. Let the author's own caution warn him as to what level or degree is involved in whatever he writes, so that he may prudently adapt the level of his style to the level of the topic. And if you seriously analyze your theme at the very beginning, the words will follow after—not words which are badly chosen or silly, but words which will flow most fittingly as from a pure and lovely fountain. (136)

## Style and Audience

.pull-right[
> When you have examined the person, the topic, and the goal, then you must weigh each according to its importance. If you write to an exalted person, use a style that is exalted; to a simple person use a style that is simple; to a friend use a friendly style; and to an enemy use a style that is bold. If a learned man is writing to one who is educated poorly or not at all, he should govern his words according to the powers of his correspondent. You must address a prelate in one way, a subject in quite another; you should address a gentle person quite differently from a demanding one; portray each one strictly according to his own charter, balancing the subject with the goal you are seeking.

## "Brilliant with Examples"

> And logic should should not stagger on (like) a widow bereaved of the support of examples; therefore, I propose you follow these suggestions. One's work should be brilliant with examples, both original and drawn from other sources. (139)

## Oral / Literate? (Tropes to Avoid)

> First of all, the discriminating man must cultivate a facility for using words accurately; one who flounders for words will not clearly be sure of how to make clear the essence of his thoughts. Nor can he hope to plant his foot firmly on the path of good usage unless he first shuts off the by-paths of bad. By "bad usage," then, I mean whatever leaves a disfiguring stain on one's eloquence; this would include barbarism, solecisms, and such things. (142)

## Lucifer?

.pull-left[
> There is also another source from which a brilliance by no means negligible attaches itself to a composition; indeed it is as splendid in its effect on a work as is Lucifer who shines more brightly than the heavens. This technique is called repetition, and there is no doubt that it takes many different forms. (143)

> But why say any more? All books (books that are worth while, I mean) abound in this kind of device. So study this sort of thing very diligently; after studying it, practice it; as you practice, learn to keep a tight rein on it—a tight rein, so that it does not take over control of what you are writing ...

## Metaphor

.pull-left[
> The metaphor is a trope which frequently appears in writing, and which contributes a certain apparent dignity. For the method of speaking in metaphors has this characteristic: it turns one's attention from the particular qualities of the object [being described]; somehow, by this distraction of attention, it makes the object seem something different; by making it seem different, it clothes it, so to speak, in a fresh new wedding garment; by so clothing it, it sells us on the idea that there is some new nobility bestowed. (146)

## Figures

> Now I must not overlook the use of double-talk (*circumscriptionem*), which has the power of applying the beautiful appearance of eloquence to the process of avoiding honest statements; it uses vague generalities to clothe lies so that they will appear to be something else. This technique appears, indeed, under many guises; frequently, the use of figures is designed to further it. Since there are so many other (flaws in style) let us pass over them in silence as vulgar. We will proceed instead to the proper function of the work. (148)

class: persuasion
## Persuasion and Style

> It often happens also that a written work involves persuasion or dissuasion, or praise or blame. And if you want to apply the beauty of style to these, if you seek to enhance them either by witty thoughts or clever words, you must on no account ignore or overlook what follows. When you seek to win someone over by persuasion, you must establish and demonstrate the dignity of whatever it is that you are calling for. Indeed the very mention of nobility to one who yearns for it will of itself increase that yearning. And if you can remember to show utility as well, you will add fuel to the fire. For when longing is based upon dignity, then usefulness will fan the flame. And the persuasion will lack no strength at all if these two arguments are accompanied by a third—the argument of possibility. (153)
