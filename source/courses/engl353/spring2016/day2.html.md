> Assuming the context of a largely non-literate culture, we can postulate that both pieces were presented to audiences less "literate" than the speaker. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed to be delivered orally. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed, in large part, during the initial presentation and only later written down in full ... what survives of Parmenides and Gorgias represents a strange case of "literate" discourse presented to a preponderantly "illiterate" audience (Swearingen 147-8).

> Gorgias' text exemplifies several "literate" features: definition of attributes, contrasts, and opposites; explicit statement of authorial/rhetorical purpose; and explicit identification of Gorgias as the composer and originator of the defense. There is no trace of even a vestigially formulaic attribution to the muse or God, except perhaps in the repetition of the story of Zeus is Helen's real father. But most of all, observe how Gorgias' argument is clearly marked *as an argument*, with metalinguistic terms and phrases that define structural and logical relationships among its statements (Swearingen 149).

> The more convincing case for their "literacy," however, is made by their use of terms and internal structures not present in the traditional Homeric canon (Swearingen 150).

> Gorgias is explicitly conscious of constructing a defense using tactics that will be persuasive, a concern which becomes part of the defense. Parmenides, though similarly concerned with transmitting views and presumably with being persuasive, articulate his "views," "positions," and "argument" as a series of oracular pronouncements received from the Goddess. We can at least speculate that by Gorgias' time,  40 years after Parmenides', there was an audience which, though probably still not literate, was familiar with both the terms and structures of Gorgias' defense (Swearingen 151).

## Space of Rhetoric: The Law Courts (George Kennedy)

1. Assembly
	* Any adult male could speak in the Assembly but no one had to.
1. Law
	* Juries were 201 members (or 501 in important cases)
	* The accuser and the accused spoke for themselves unless in the case of illness
	* Trial Format:
		* Evidence (testimony) is read before the jury
		* Accuser presents his case based on testimony
		* Accused issues a rebuttal

## Arguments from Probablity (*eikos*) (Tisias)

> If a weak and a brave man, having beaten up a strong and cowardly man, is brought into court, neither must tell the truth. The coward must claim that he was not beaten by a single brave man: that is, he must claim to have been attacked by two or more; whereas the other must refute this, insisting that the two of them were alone, in order to use the argument "How could one like me have attacked a big one like him" (*Phaedrus*)

## Sophistic Rhetorical Practice

> Speeches were generated out of common materials arranged with some spontaneity for the occasion and purpose at hand. To prepare for performance, small seminar-type groups of students working with an accomplished rhetorician would listen to and memorize speeches composed by their teacher and would practice composing and delivering speeches among themselves (Jarratt and Ong).
