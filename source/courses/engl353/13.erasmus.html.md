## Practice

> It remains for me now to give some brief advice on the exercises by which this faculty may be developed. Once we have carefully committed the theory to memory, we should frequently take a group of sentences and deliberately set out to express each of them in as many versions as possible, as Quintilian advises, using the analogy of a piece of wax which can be moulded into one shape after another. This exercise will be more profitable if a group of students competes together orally or in writing on a common theme; they will all be helped individually by the suggestions made by other members of the group, and each of them will have his imagination stimulated by being given a starting-point. (I.ix)

## Collecting and Choosing
> One should collect a vast supply of words like this from all sides out of good authors, provide oneself with a varied equipment, and, as Quintilian remarks, heap up riches so that we find we have a wealth of words to hand whenever we require it. It will not be sufficient to prepare a copious apparatus or an abundant store of such words unless you have them not only at the ready but in full view, so that they present themselves to the eyes even if you are not looking for them. But here we must take special care not to do what some do and use the first thing that presents itself out of the heap in any context without exercising any choice at all. For in the first place you will hardly find two words anywhere so isodynamic that they are not kept apart by some distinction. What could be more identical in meaning than men and mortals? Yet the man who on every occasion said *all mortals* for *all men* was stigmatized in the words of the Greek proverb [sweet oils on lentils]. (I.xi)

## Placing Words

> There are many things for which the poets use one set of words, orators another. There are also words peculiar to different ages and centuries, and even the same authors often express the same thing by different means. So the first thing is to extract the best words one can from every type of writer, and whatever they are like, add them to the collection. No word is to be rejected, provided it occurs in an author who is at all respectable, for there is no word which would not be best one in some place or other. So however vulgar, unusual, poetic, archaic, novel, obsolete, harsh, barbarous, or foreign it may be, lay it up in its proper niche with its fellows, so that you may summon it if ever a use for it arises. (I.xi)
