## Arguments from Probablity (*eikos*) (Tisias)

> If a weak and a brave man, having beaten up a strong and cowardly man, is brought into court, neither must tell the truth. The coward must claim that he was not beaten by a single brave man: that is, he must claim to have been attacked by two or more; whereas the other must refute this, insisting that the two of them were alone, in order to use the argument "How could one like me have attacked a big one like him" (*Phaedrus*)
