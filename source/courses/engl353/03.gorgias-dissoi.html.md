## Role of Repetition

>(1) A very great and most attractive discovery that has been made for the way we live is [the power of] memory; it is useful for all purposes, for both general education and practical wisdom.
>
>(2) This is true, [as you will see] if you concentrate your attention [upon the matter]. For by following this course your mind will come to perceive more 'as a whole' that which you have learned.
>
>(3) Second, you must, whenever you hear anything, go over it carefully. For by frequent repetition of what you hear you commit it to memory.
>
>(4) Third, you must, whenever you hear anything, connect it to what you know, as in the following example: you need to remember the name Chrysippus? Then you ought to connect it with χρυσός
>(gold) and ίππος (horse). (9.1-4, 141-143)

## Education

> (12) And if someone is not convinced that we learn our words, but feels sure we are born knowing them, let him ascertain the truth from the following evidence: should a person send a child to Persia immediately it was born and have it brought up there without ever hearing the speech of Greece, the child would speak Persian; should one bring the child from Persia to Greece, the child would speak Greek. That is the way we learn words, and we do not know who it was who taught us. (6.12, 135)

## The Case For One-ness

> On the matter of what is good and what is bad contrasting arguments are put forward in Greece by educated people: some say that what is good and what is bad are two different things, others that they are the same thing, and that the same thing is good for some but bad for others, or at one time good and at another time bad for the same person.
> 
> (2) For myself, I side with the latter group, and I shall examine the view by reference to human life, with its concern for food and drink and sex. For these things are bad for those who are sick, but good for the person who is healthy and needs them.
> 
> (3) Or again, lack of restraint in these matters is bad for those who lack restraint, but good for those who sell these commodities and make money out of them. And illness is bad for the sick but good for the doctors. And death is bad for those who die, but good for the undertakers and the grave-diggers. (1.1-3, 99)

## The Case for Duality

> (11) Another view is that what is good is one thing and what is bad is another thing; as the name differs, so likewise does the reality. I myself also distinguish the two in the above-mentioned manner. For I think it not even clear what sort of thing would be good and what sort of thing bad if each of the two were the same thing and not different things; the situation would be an astonishing one indeed.
> 
> (12) And I think that the man who says the above-mentioned things would not even be able to make a reply if someone were to put the following question: "Tell me now, did you ever before now do to your parents anything that was good?" He might say, "Yes, I did a great deal that was very good." "In that case you ought to do them a great deal that is very bad , if what is good and what is bad are the same thing.
> 
> (13) Tell me, did you ever before now do to your relatives anything that was good? In such a case you were doing them something bad. Or tell me, did you ever before now do harm to your enemies? In such a case you did them a great deal that was very beneficial. (1.11-13, 103)

## Another Example

> (1) Contrasting arguments are also put forward on the matter of what is just and what is unjust. Some say that what is just and what is unjust are two different things, others that the same thing is just and unjust. For my part, I shall attempt to bolster the latter view.
> 
> (2) And I shall say first of all that it is just to tell lies and to deceive. Opponents of this view might say that doing these things to one's enemies is shameful and base; yet they would not say that it is shameful and base to do them to those whom one holds very dear — parents, for example. For if it were necessary that one's father or mother should consume some medicament (whether in solid or liquid form), but he or she was unwilling, is it not just to give them the medicament in their food or in their drink and not say that it is in it?
> 
> (3) So it is already clear that it is just to tell lies and to deceive one's parents, and for that matter to steal the property of one's friends and use violence on those whom one holds very dear. (3.1-3, 115-117)

## Context for Speaking

>(7) For if one were to ask them if dementedness differs from sanity or wisdom from ignorance, they say "Yes".
>
>(8) For it is quite obvious, even from the actions of each group, that they will grant this point. So even if they do the same things (as the demented do) the wise are not demented, nor the demented wise, nor is everything turned into confusion.
>
>(9) And one ought to bring up the question whether it is those who are sane or those who are demented who speak at the right moment. For whenever one asks them they say that the two groups say the same things, only the wise say them at the right moment and the demented at moments when it is not proper.
>
>(10) And in saying this they seem to me to have added the small phrases "when it is proper" and "when it is not proper", with the result that it is no longer the same thing. (5.7-10, 127-129)

## Proper Context

> (15) As for the affirmation that the same man exists and does not exist I ask, "Does he exist in some particular respect or in every respect?"Thus, if anyone denies that the man in question exists, he is making the mistake of asserting "in every respect". The conclusion is that all these things exist in some way. (5.15, 131)

## The Weaker Argument

>(1) I consider it a characteristic of the same man and of the same art to be able to converse in brief
>questions and answers, to know the truth of things, to plead one's cause correctly, to be able to speak in public, to have an understanding of argument-skills, and to teach people about the nature of everything  —  both how everything is and how it came into being.
>
>(2) First of all, will not the man who knows about the nature of everything also be able to act rightly in regard to everything?
>
>(3) Furthermore, the man acquainted with the skills involved in argument will also know how to speak correctly on every topic.
>
>(4) For the man who intends to speak correctly must speak on the topics of which he has knowledge; and he will, one must at any rate suppose, have knowledge of everything.
>
>(5) For he has knowledge of all argument-skills, and all arguments are about everything that is. (8.1-5, 137-9)
