## The Ideal Courtier

> However, I would have our Courtier keep one precept firmly in mind, namely, in this as in everything else, to be cautious and reserved rather than forward, and take care not to get the mistaken notion that he knows something he does not know. For we are all by nature more avid of praise than we ought to be and, more than any other sweet song or sound, our ears love the melody of words that praise us; and thus, like Sirens' voices, they are the cause of shipwreck to him who does not stop his ears to such beguiling harmony. (71)

## *Sprezzatura*

> But, having thought many times already about how this grace is acquired (leaving aside those who have it from the stars), I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems to me valid above all others, and in all human affairs whether in word or deed: and that is to avoid affectation in every way possible as though it were some very rough and dangerous reef; and (to pronounce a new word perhaps) to practice in all things a certain *sprezzatura* [nonchalance], so as to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it. (43)

## True Art

> Therefore we may call that art true art which does not seem to be art; nor must one be more careful of anything than of concealing it, because if it is discovered, this robs a man of all credit and causes him to be held in slight esteem. And I remember having read of certain most excellent orators in ancient times who, among the other things they did, tried to make everyone believe that they had no knowledge whatever of letters; and, dissembling their knowledge, they made their orations appear to be composed in the simplest manner and according to the dictates of nature and truth rather than of effort and art; which fact, had it been known, would have inspired in the minds of the people the fear that they could be duped by it. (43-44)

## Affectation

> So you see how art, or any intent effort, if it is disclosed, deprives everything of grace. Who among you fails to laugh when our messer Pierpaolo dances after his own fashion, with those capers of his, his legs stiff on tiptoe, never moving his head, as if he were a stick of wood, and all this so studied that he really seems to be counting his steps? What eye is so blind as not to see in this the ungainliness of affectation; and not to see the grace of that cool *disinvoltura* [ease] (for when it is a matter of bodily movements many call it that) in many of the men and women here present, who seem in words, in laughter, in posture not to care; or seem to be thinking more of everything than of that, so as to cause all who are watching them to believe that they are almost incapable of making a mistake?

## Musical Example

> Then the Magnifico Giuliano said: "It holds true as well in music, wherein it is a great mistake to place two perfect consonances one after the other, for our sense of hearing abhors this, whereas it often enjoys a second or a seventh which in itself is a harsh and unbearable discord. And this is due to the fact that to continue in perfect consonances generates satiety and gives evidence of a too affected harmony, which is avoided when imperfect consonances are mixed in, establishing a kind of comparison, by which our ears are held in greater suspense, and more avidly wait upon and enjoy the perfect consonances, delighting in that discord of the second or seventh as in something that shows nonchalance."
>
> "So, you see," replied the Count, "that affectation is detrimental in this as in other things.…"  (45-6)

## Vernacular

> First I will say that, in my opinion, this language of ours which we call the vulgar tongue is still tender and new, although it has been in use now for quite a long time. For, since Italy has not only been harried and ravaged, but long inhabited, by the barbarians, the Latin language has been corrupted and spoiled by contact with those peoples, and out of that corruption other languages have arisen; and, like the rivers that divide at the crest of the Apennines and flow into the sea on either side, so these languages also have divided, and some that were tinged with Latinity have flowed in various channels and in different directions; and one that was tinged with barbarism remained in Italy. The latter was for a long time disordered and uneven, having no one to take any care of it or to attempt to give it any splendor or grace. Yet finally it was cultivated somewhat more in Tuscany than in other parts of Italy. And for this reason it seems to have flourished there from those early times, because that people more than others have kept gentle accents in their speech and a proper grammatical order, and have had three noble writers [Dante, Petrach, Boccaccio] who expressed their thoughts ingeniously and in the words and terms that were current in their time; wherein it fell to Petrarch to do this in amorous subjects with more felicity than the others, in my opinion. (52-3)

## Language and the Age

> Then, from time to time, not only in Tuscany but in the rest of Italy, among wellborn men versed in the usages of courts, in arms, and in letters, a concern arose to speak and write more elegantly than in that first rude and uncultivated age when the fires of calamity set by the barbarians were not yet extinguished. Thus, both in the city of Florence itself and in all Tuscany, as well as in the rest of Italy, many words were abandoned, and others were taken up in their stead, thereby bringing about the change which takes place in all things human and has always taken place in other languages as well.

## Style

> Next, what one has to say or write must be given a good order. It must then be well expressed in words, which words (if I am not mistaken) must be proper, select, lustrous, and well formed, but above all be words which are still used by the people. Now it is the words themselves that make the greatness and magnificence of an oration; for if a speaker uses good judgment and care, and understands how to choose those words which best express what he wishes to say; and if he elevates them, and shapes them to his purpose like so much wax, he can give them such a disposition and an order such as to cause them to reveal at a glance their dignity and splendor, like paintings when placed in a good and natural light.

## Humor

> Then signor Morello said: "If this Courtier of ours speaks with so much elegance and gravity, I fear there may be those among us who will not understand him."
>
> "Nay," replied the Count, "all will understand him, because words that are easy to understand can still be elegant, Nor would I have him always speak of grave matters, but of amusing things, of games, jests, and jokes, according to the occasion; but sensibly in everything, with readiness and a lucid fullness; nor must he show vanity or a childish folly in any way. … " (55)

## Function of Language

> But we, being far more strict than the ancients, impose upon ourselves certain new laws that are inept; and although we have well-traveled roads before our eyes, we try to proceed along byways, for in our own language—the function of which, as of all other languages, is to express well and clearly what the mind conceives—we take pleasure in what is obscure … (57)

## Imitation

> "Then whom,” said the Count, "will you say Petrarch and Boccaccio imitated, who we might say have been in the world but a few days?"
>
>"I do not know,” replied messer Federico, but we can believe that they too were bent on imitating, even though we do not know whom.”
>
> The Count replied: "It must be thought that the imitated were better than their imitators; and, if they were good, it would be very strange if their name and fame had completely vanished so soon. But I think that their true master was talent and their own native judgment. And at this no one should wonder, for it is almost always possible to advance toward the summit of all excellence by several paths. Nor is there anything that does not comprise in its own kind a multiplicity of things which are different from one another and yet equally deserving of praise among themselves. (59-60)
