## "Your Letter Pleased Me Greatly"
]
---
## Demonstration

Let us, for example, take this sentence: "Your letter pleased me mightily"

.two-column.f16px.no-margin[
> *your*: There is no synonym for "your," but a periphrasis is possible: Your excellency's, your highness's, your majesty's. If we insert a proper name such as "Faustus" and say "Faustus's letter," we employ two forms of heterosis, the substitution of a noun for a pronoun and of a third person for a second. If we say "Faustine letters," using a derivative adjective instead of the genitive of the noun, that is yet another form of heterosis.
>
> *letter*: epistle, letter, note (synonym); epistolet, letterette, notelet (heterosis); pages, lines (synecdoche); what you wrote to me (periphrasis).
>
> *pleased*: delighted, refreshed, exhilarated (synonyms, though "exhilarated" is better considered a metaphor); brought pleasure, were a pleasure, were delightful (these and similar expressions illustrate periphrasis); bathed in delight, were honey-sweet, and so on (transferred or metaphorical expressions); were not unwelcome, not unpleasing (these result from the interchange of opposites). 
>
> *me*: my spirits, my heart, my eyes (periphrasis or Synecdoche); us (enallage of the number); Erasmus (heterosis of the person).
>
> *mightily*: greatly, intensely, extremely, wonderfully, marvellously, extraordinarily (synonym); mightily, hugely, superlatively, exceedingly, singularly (*auxesis* heightening); in no scant measure, on no small scale, in no common manner (opposites and negatives); it is impossible to say how much, it is beyond belief, I could not find words to express (these and similar expressions are on the way to hyperbole).(I.xxxiii)

## Rhetorical Machines

> Erasmus’s most famous exercise of writing the sentence “tuae litterae me magnopere delectarunt” nearly two hundred different ways is a perfect example of an algorithmic attunement to language, a procedure that once again calls into question who or what is being trained and what kind of rhetor emerges from *De copia*’s pedagogical contraptions. Erasmus is demonstrating the output of these machines, but he is primarily focused on laying out his weird collection of whatsits, a curio cabinet of mechanisms that iterate through loops, spitting out arguments.
