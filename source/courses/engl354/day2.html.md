> Assuming the context of a largely non-literate culture, we can postulate that both pieces were presented to audiences less "literate" than the speaker. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed to be delivered orally. Both pieces were delivered orally and were in that sense composed, in large part, during the initial presentation and only later written down in full ... what survives of Parmenides and Gorgias represents a strange case of "literate" discourse presented to a preponderantly "illiterate" audience (Swearingen 147-8).

> Gorgias is explicitly conscious of constructing a defense using tactics that will be persuasive, a concern which becomes part of the defense. Parmenides, though similarly concerned with transmitting views and presumably with being persuasive, articulate his "views," "positions," and "argument" as a series of oracular pronouncements received from the Goddess. We can at least speculate that by Gorgias' time,  40 years after Parmenides', there was an audience which, though probably still not literate, was familiar with both the terms and structures of Gorgias' defense (Swearingen 151).

## Arguments from Probability (*eikos*) (Tisias)

> If a weak and a brave man, having beaten up a strong and cowardly man, is brought into court, neither must tell the truth. The coward must claim that he was not beaten by a single brave man: that is, he must claim to have been attacked by two or more; whereas the other must refute this, insisting that the two of them were alone, in order to use the argument "How could one like me have attacked a big one like him" (*Phaedrus*)
