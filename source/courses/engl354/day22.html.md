## Discussion Question (McKenna)

> This continuing pattern has encouraged many teachers of English to turn— among other things— computer supported writing environments as places within which they and students can try to enact educational practices that are more democratic and less systematically oppressive: for example, student-centered, on-line discussion groups in which individuals discover their own motivations for using language; on-line conferences in which students’ race, gender, age, and sexual preference may not figure in the same ways that they do in more conventional face-to-face settings; collaborative groups in which students learn to negotiate discursive power.

Which do you feel more comfortable in— online discourse groups like we see a lot on eCampus, or discussion within an actual class? Is your answer based on how comfortable you are or because of connivence? Do you believe the “rhetoric of technology” is actually better for students and a class overall?

## Discussion Question (Vanessa)

> For the last decade, English composition teachers have been using computers in classrooms to create electronic forums—on local-area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs)—within which writers and readers can create, exchange, and comment on texts. These spaces, it has been noted, have the potential for supporting student-centered learning and discursive practices that can be different from—and some claim— more engaging and democratic than those occurring within traditional classroom settings?

Do you think English teachers should incorporate more technology into their classrooms in order to enhance their students’ education about English literature, or do you think that educators should keep English literature classes to their traditional format of reading and writing everything from textbooks, novels, and papers?

If you agree that more technology should be implemented into our educational classrooms, would you say that there should be a limit on the amount of time or percentage of technology that should be implemented? Why or why not?

## Power Along the Edges

> As Midwesterners who live relatively far from the border in question, we were taken aback by the story-by the guards' reactions, by the feelings these reactions suggest about Mexican nationals, and by the treatment that people of color receive every day in our own country. We should not, of course, have been surprised at all. It is at the geopolitical borders of countries that the formations of social power, normally hidden, are laid embarrassingly bare-where power in its rawest form is exercised. (481)
---
## Computational Contact Zones

> As a way into this examination, we look at computer interfaces as linguistic contact zones, in Mary Louise Pratt's words, "social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in many parts of the world today" (34). Within this context, we talk about computer interfaces as maps that enact-among other things-the gestures and deeds of colonialism, continuously and with a great deal of success. This is not to claim, of course, that the only educational effects computers have is one of re-producing oppression or colonial mentalities. Indeed, from the work of computers and composition specialists, it is clear that computers, like other complex technologies, are articulated in many ways with a range of existing cultural forces and with a variety of projects in our educational system, projects that run the gamut from liberatory to oppressive.

## Utopia of Technological Teaching

> These spaces, it has been noted, have the potential for supporting student-centered learning and discursive practices that can be different from, and-some claim-more engaging and democratic than those occurring within traditional classroom settings. Such a vision is all the more tantalizing given our recognition that the education taking place in traditional classrooms-despite our best intentions-contributes, in part, to a continuing cultural tendency to marginalize and oppress groups of people due to their race, gender, or ethnic background. (482-483)

## Dangerous Visions

> And if this rhetoric is helpful in that it describes what we want to happen-and sometimes, to some extent, does happen-in our classrooms, it is also dangerous. Through its use, we legitimate the status quo of computer use and, as Hawisher and Selfe note, "de-legitimate critique"(53)-thus allowing ourselves to think erroneously that the use of computers and networks provides discursive landscapes that are, in Mary Louise Pratt's words, "the same for all players"(38). (483-484)

## Computers: Double-Edged Swords

> If we hope to get English composition teachers to recognize how our use of computers achieves both great good and great evil-often at the same time, as Joseph Weizenbaum points out-we have to educate them to be technology *critics* as well as technology users. This recognition requires that composition teachers acquire the intellectual habits of reflecting on and discussing the cultural and ideological characteristics of technology-and the implications of these characteristics-in educational contexts. With such a realization, we maintain, English composition teachers can begin to exert an increasingly active influence on the cultural project of technology design. (484)

## Eurocentric Geographies

> We can, however, provide an extended example of the agenda we want to pursue by focusing in particular ways on computer interfaces, those primary representations of computer systems or programs that show up on screens used by both teachers and students. Within the virtual space represented by these interfaces, and elsewhere within computer systems, the values of our culture-ideological, political, economic, educational-are mapped both implicitly and explicitly, constituting a complex set of material relations among culture, technology, and technology users. In effect, interfaces are cultural maps of computer systems, and as Denis Wood points out, such maps are never ideologically innocent or inert. Like other maps that Wood mentions-the medieval *mappaemundi* that offer a Christian-centered vision of the 13th century world or the [Mercater projection](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcf.ydcdn.net%2F1.0.1.16%2Fimages%2Fmain%2FMercator%2520projection.jpg&f=1) that provides a Euro-centric view of the Earth's geography in the 20th century-the maps of computer interfaces order the virtual world according to a certain set of historical and social values that make up our culture. (485)

## Cultural Information on Maps

> The users of maps, as a result, read cultural information just as surely as they read geographical information—through a coherent set of stereotyped images that the creators of maps offer as "direct testimony" (Berger 69) of the world, of social formations and socially organized tendencies, of a culture's historical development (Wood 145). The enhanced power of maps, growing out of their long association with the projects of science and geography, resides in the fact that they purport to represent fact-the world, a particular space-as it is in reality, while they naturalize the political and ideological interests of their authors (Wood 2). (485)
---
## Interfacing Class

> In general, computer interfaces present reality as framed in the perspective of modern capitalism, thus, orienting technology along an existing axis of class privilege. The graphically intuitive Macintosh interface provides a good example of this orientation. That interface, and the software applications commonly represented within it, map the virtual world as a *desktop*constructing virtual reality, by association, in terms of corporate culture and the values of professionalism. This reality is constituted by and for white middleand upper-class users to replicate a world that they know and feel comfortable within. The objects represented within this world are those familiar primarily to the white-collar inhabitants of that corporate culture: manila folders, files, documents, telephones, fax machines, clocks and watches, and desk calendars. We can grasp the power of this ideological orientation-and thus sense its implications-by shifting our perspective to what it does not include, what it leaves unstated. The interface does not, for example, represent the world in terms of a kitchen counter top, a mechanic's workbench, or a fast-food restaurant. (486-7)

## Who Is Left Out

> These images signal-to users of color, to users who come from a non-English language background, to users from low socio-economic backgrounds-that entering the virtual worlds of interfaces also means, at least in part and at some level, entering a world constituted around the lives and values of white, male, middle- and upper-class professionals. Users of color, users from non-English language background, users from a low socio-economic class who view this map of reality, submit-if only partially and momentarily-to an interested version of reality represented in terms of both language and image.

## Standards

> To change ASCII, however, is to work against a complex set of tendential forces encouraging inertia-because changing ASCII means changing existing software, hardware, documentation, and programming approaches. It also requires that individuals and groups in the computer industry abandon English as the natural language of, the natural standard for, computer technology. Such changes do not happen easily or quickly. (491)
---
## What Interfaces Validate

> If the map of the interface is oriented simultaneously along the axes of class, race, and cultural privilege, it is also aligned with the values of rationality, hierarchy, and logocentrism characteristic of Western patriarchal cultures. IBM's DOS environment, for example, is fundamentally dependent on an hierarchical representation of knowledge, a perspective characteristically-while not exclusively-associated with patriarchal cultures and rationalistic traditions of making meaning. This way of representing knowledge within computer environments, although not essentially limiting or exclusive by itself, becomes so when linked to a positivist value on rationality and logic as foundational ways of knowing that function to exclude other ways of knowing, such as association, intuition, or bricolage. This validation of positivism, rationality, hierarchy, and logic as the only authorized contexts for "knowing" and representing knowledge continues to inform-and limit-many formal aspects of computer programming and technology design. (491-492)
---
## Bricolage

> Such methods of programming and designing computer interfaces, some computer designers contend, can support alternative approaches to constructing meaning-though "bricolage," for example, a term that Turkle and Papert (135) use in reference to the work of Claude Levi-Strauss. Bricolage, as Turkle and Papert employ the term, refers to the construction of meaning through the arrangement and rearrangement of concrete, well known materials, often in an intuitive rather than logical manner. Bricoleurs get to know a subject by interacting with it physically, by manipulating materials, or symbols, or icons in rich associative patterns, by arranging and re-arranging them constantly until they fit together in a satisfying or meaningful way. Bricoleurs reason "from within" (144) to come to an understanding of a problem through a direct "physical path of access" (145) rather than reasoning with the help of a traditionally validated pattern of logical representation that depends on objective distancing. (493)

## Master Narratives

> Given the characteristics of the interface as a linguistic contact zone, our uses of computers in English classrooms certainly seem capable of supporting what Henry Giroux calls "imperialist master narratives" (57) of colonial dominance, even as they make the promise of technological liberation and progress. Students who want to use computers are continually confronted with these grand narratives which foreground a value on middle-class, corporate culture; capitalism and the commodification of information; Standard English; and rationalistic ways of representing knowledge. These values simultaneously do violence to and encourage the rejection of the languages of different races and the values of non-dominant cultural and gender groups. When students from these groups enter the linguistic borderlands of the interface, in other words, they often learn that they must abandon their own culture or gender and acknowledge the dominance of other groups. (494)

## Progress, Modernism, Interface

> We get, indeed, a master narrative that resonates all too successfully with modernist myths of technological progress: Civilization and reason, as manifested in a increasingly literate people, are supported in their historical evolution by continual improvements of industry and science. If teachers hear this resonance, we think they understand the need to identify and correct the tone. 
---
## Interfaces are Complicated

> For both teachers and students, Giroux notes, the project of eliminating oppression based on class, race, and gender involves "an ongoing contest within every aspect of daily life," a continual project of mapping and re-mapping the educational, political, and ideological spaces we want to occupy." He continues, "no tradition should ever be seen as received in this project" (155-156). In this sense, English teachers cannot be content to understand the maps of computer interfaces as simple, uncomplicated spaces. Rather, we need to prepare ourselves and the students with whom we work to map these virtual spaces as sites of "multiple and heterogeneous borders where different histories, languages, experiences, and voices intermingle amidst diverse relations of power and privilege" (Giroux 169). (500)

## How's this Going?

> In addition, software designers for the Macintosh have already published scores of alternative icons and images that can be used by English composition teachers, and students, to customize primary computer interfaces. Matrix Communication Associates of Pittsburgh, for instance, is now marketing a package of African American computer graphics and has plans to market graphics packages that more adequately represent other ethnic groups as well (Creedy).
