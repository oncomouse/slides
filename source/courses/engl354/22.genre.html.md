* Think about eulogies: across time, these texts should have similar features as they respond to a similar situation

## Examples of Genre

> Among the genres that are widespread in everyday life are various genres of greetings, farewells, and congratulations. Weather forecasts, advertisements, instruction manuals, the closing arguments at a criminal trial, travel blogs, websites for presidential candidates, and personal home pages are all genres. If you are a graduate student, you participated in the genre of the personal statement required of graduate-student applications in the U.S., and you may be looking forward to writing your thesis, which is another genre. Different communities use different types of genres and thus have different genre repertoires or sets of genres that they routinely enact. In academic communities, for example, knowledge production is carried out and documented through the genres of lab reports, grant proposals, conference papers, journal articles, reviews of journal manuscripts, books, and book reviews. Corporations often use generic forms of communication such as expense forms, business letters, training seminars, and annual shareholders’ meetings. They might employ email genres such as the dialogue genre, which embeds old messages into a new message, and the proposal genre, in which the writer proposes or advocates for a particular course of action.

## Why Genre?

* Genre is a kind of contract between the form and the rhetor
* "Genres not only sort and classify rhetoric, but they help shape and generate the types of rhetoric we employ"

* Genre is a kind of contract between the form and the rhetor
* "Genres not only sort and classify rhetoric, but they help shape and generate the types of rhetoric we employ"
* "[Genres] serve as prescriptive, ready-made patterns of communication that you can use as templates"

* "[Genres] serve as prescriptive, ready-made patterns of communication that you can use as templates"
* "When you are asked to present an award to someone at a banquet or ceremony, for example, you are likely to draw on the content and form of the award-giving genre to prepare your remarks, and your speech will be much like other speeches used to bestow awards. Just as rhetors are being influenced by genres available to them as they create messages, audience members recognize particular messages as belonging to specific genres, and that recognition influences their strategies of comprehension and response."

## Practicing Genre Analysis

* Three critical modes:

## Practicing Genre Analysis

* Three critical modes:
	1. *generic description* – "artifacts should be a variety of texts that appear to respond to a similar situation and, on the surface, to share some rhetorical similarities"

## Practicing Genre Analysis

* Three critical modes:
	1. *generic description* – "artifacts should be a variety of texts that appear to respond to a similar situation and, on the surface, to share some rhetorical similarities"
	2. *generic participation* – "an artifact that seems like it should belong to or has been assigned to a particular genre but does not seem to fit"

	3. *generic application* – "artifact should be one that you want to assess in terms of how well it conforms to the genre of which it is a part"

## Generic Description

> In the attempt to describe a genre, a critic examines various artifacts to see if a genre exists. Your purpose in generic description is to define a genre and formulate theoretical constructs about its characteristics if, in fact, you discover that a genre exists. Generic description involves four steps: (1) observing similarities in rhetorical responses to particular situations; (2) collecting artifacts that occur in similar situations; (3) analyzing the artifacts to discover if they share characteristics; and (4) if they do share characteristics, formulating the organizing principle of the genre. (184)

## Generic Participation

> A critic who engages in generic participation determines which artifacts participate in which genres. This involves a deductive process in which you test an instance of rhetoric against the characteristics of a genre. Generic participation involves three steps: (1) describing the perceived situational requirements, substantive and stylistic strategies, and organizing principle of a genre; (2) describing the perceived situational requirements, substantive and stylistic strategies, and organizing principle of an artifact; and (3) comparing the characteristics of the artifact with those of the genre to discover if the artifact belongs in that genre. You then use these findings to confirm the characteristics of the genre or to suggest modifications in it. (188)

## Generic Application

> Your task here is to apply the situational, stylistic, and substantive elements that characterize a genre to a specific artifact that participates in that genre in order to assess it. Once you have applied the generic characteristics to the specific model, you are able to determine if the artifact is a good or poor example of the genre.
>
> Four basic steps are involved in generic application (the first three are the same as the steps for generic participation): (1) describing the perceived situational requirements, substantive and stylistic strategies, and organizing principle of a genre; (2) describing the perceived situational requirements, substantive and stylistic strategies, and organizing principle of an artifact that is representative of that genre; (3) comparing the characteristics of the artifact with those of the genre; and (4) evaluating the artifact according to its success in fulfilling the required characteristics of the genre.

## Research Question

> In *generic description*, your research questions are: “Does a genre exist among a set of artifacts? If so, what are the characteristics of the genre?” In *generic participation*, your research question is: “Does this artifact participate in a particular genre?” In *generic application*, the question with which you are concerned is: “Is this artifact successful in fulfilling the required characteristics of its genre?” (190)

## Exercise

* We have 3 texts that derive a "miserable writer trapped on a theme cruise" genre from "Shipping Out":
	* What features do they share?
* Generic Description
	1. Read your assigned paper
	2. What features does it take from "Shipping Out?"
	3. What features do you see as part of this genre?
