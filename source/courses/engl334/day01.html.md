## Hugo Gernsback

> "By 'scientifiction' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge... in a very palatable form... New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at all impossible of realization tomorrow... Many great science stories destined to be of historical interest are still to be written... Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not only in literature and fiction, but progress as well."

## Robert Heinlein

> "Realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method. To make this definition cover all science fiction (instead of 'almost all') it is necessary only to strike out the word 'future'.”

## Theordore Sturgeon

> “A science fiction story is a story built around human beings, with a human problem, and a human solution, which would not have happened at all without its scientific content.”
---
## Frederik Pohl

> “Someone once said that a good science-fiction story should be able to predict not the automobile but the traffic jam.”
---
## Darko Suvin

> Science fiction is "a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author's empirical environment."
---
## Norman Spinrad

> “Science fiction is anything published as science fiction”
