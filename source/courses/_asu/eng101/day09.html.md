## Skeleton Outline

1. My position is that The Burrito Shack is the best place at ASU Poly to eat lunch.
1. The Burrito Shack offers reasonably tasty, affordable burritos just off campus.
1. The Burrito Shack also offers a wide-range of combinations and offerings for every style of eater.
1. Other restaurants actually on campus do not have the same level of quality and flavor.
1. Additionally, focus on fresh, quality ingredients and many burrito options that feature vegetables makes The Burrito Shack a cut above the mostly fast food places that surround our campus.
1. Some might complain that the best place to eat on campus cannot be off campus, but I say that this issue of little concern.
1. Eating well at ASU Poly is important for maintaining a healthy and happy student body.
1. Arizona-style Mexican cuisine is delicious and a unique characteristic of our area.
1. Supporting local small business owners can make other restaurants near campus an enticing business prospect.
1. In conclusion, The Burrito Shack is worth the drive off campus.
