# "Bartleby the Scrivener"

---



## Turkey

> There are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after twelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went further, and was rather noisy.

## Nippers

>  In short, the truth of the matter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to be rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients.Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged title-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he caused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to me.

---

## Not "Problems" But "Eccentricities"

> It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause—indigestion—the irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that Turkey’s paroxysms only coming on about twelve o’clock, **I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time**. Their fits relieved each other like guards. When Nippers’ was on, Turkey’s was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances.

*****

> If I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with **some less indulgent employer**, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth miserably to starve.

---

## Turkey's Coat

>  The truth was, I suppose, **that a man with so small an income, could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time**. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for red ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat. **It made him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed**.

## Bartleby's Eccentricity?

> At first Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long famishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents. There was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by sun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his application, had be been cheerfully industrious. **But he wrote on silently, palely, mechanically.**

*****

> Furthermore, I was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay again, **whatever might be his eccentricities**, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person.

## Will / Prefer / Prefer Not

> “I would prefer not to.”
>
> “You _will_ not?”
>
> “I _prefer_ not.”

****

> “Mr. Nippers,” said I, “I’d prefer that you would withdraw for the present.”

****

> “Turkey,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”
>
> “Oh, certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”

## "I Am Not Particular"

>  “No; I would prefer not to make any change.”
>
> “Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?”
>
> “There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a clerkship; but **I am not particular**.”
>
> “Too much confinement,” I cried, “why you keep yourself confined all the time!”
>
> “I would prefer not to take a clerkship,” he rejoined, as if to settle that little item at once.
>
> “How would a bar-tender’s business suit you? There is no trying of the eyesight in that.”
>
> “I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, **I am not particular**.”

## What Does Money Buy?
### Freedom To / Freedom From
]

> And as the idea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep occupying my chambers, and **denying my authority**; and perplexing my visitors; and scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over the premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (**for doubtless he spent but half a dime a day**), and in the end perhaps outlive me, and claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy

---

## You Can't Buy Happiness

> “I would prefer _not_ to quit you,” he replied, gently emphasizing the _not_.

****

> “I know you,” he said, without looking round,—“and I **want** nothing to say to you.”
>
> “It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,” said I, keenly pained at his implied suspicion. “And to you, this should not be so vile a place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it is not so sad a place as one might think. **Look, there is the sky, and here is the grass**.”
>
> “I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so I left him.
---

## Almost Getting It

> At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my exasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his conduct. Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don’t mean any thing; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.
---

## Soul, Not For Sale

> “Bartleby,” said I, in a still gentler tone, “come here; I am not going to ask you to do any thing you would prefer not to do—I simply wish to speak to you.”
>
> Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.
>
> “Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?”
>
> “I would prefer not to.”
>
> “Will you tell me any thing about yourself?”
>
> “I would prefer not to.”


---

## Charity For Who?

> Finally, I resolved upon this;—I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning, touching his history, &c., and if he declined to answer then openly and reservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty dollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services were no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I would be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native place, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses. Moreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid, a letter from him would be sure of a reply.

## Unsex Me Here

> Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but unmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises

---

## Bartleby the Typewriter

> “I would prefer not to,” said he.
>
> I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least uneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words, **had there been any thing ordinarily human about him**, doubtless I should have violently dismissed him from the premises. But as it was, **I should have as soon thought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors**.

## I Am Not Jack's Misrouted Mail

> Dead letters! does it not sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a pallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that of continually handling these dead letters and assorting them for the flames? For by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded paper the pale clerk takes a ring:—the finger it was meant for, perhaps, moulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity:—he whom it would relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died despairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died stifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to death.

> Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!
