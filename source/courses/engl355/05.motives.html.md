## Motives? of Style

> Although we feature the term “motive” throughout this chapter, we are not interested in recovering the intent of an author—in fact, we believe that intent is ultimately inaccessible, even to authors themselves. Instead, we survey the various ways writers and analysts explain stylistic behaviors to either themselves or others. Typically, these explanations will name, or at least imply, an orientation toward one of the elements of the rhetorical situation: language, subject matter, writer, or reader. (*PP* 18)

## Motives Focused on Language

> “the,” “a,” and “an.” Although articles can serve a number of functions, one of their most important is to tag a piece of information as new or already known to readers. Consider these three sentences from Alice Munro’s short story “The Moons of Jupiter”:
> 
> A small screen hung over his head. On the screen a bright jagged line was continually being written.  e writing was accompanied by a nervous electronic beeping. (Selected Stories 307)

## Motives Focused on Language II

Opening of Armstrong's *Sounder*:

> The tall man stood at the edge of the porch. The roof sagged from the two rough posts which held it, almost closing the gap between his head and the ra ers. Thee dim light from the cabin window cast long equal shadows from man and posts. A boy stood nearby shivering in the cold October wind. He ran his fingers back and forth over the broad crown of the head of a coon dog named Sounder. (1)

## Motives Focused on Language: Coordination

> In the hands of a skilled stylist, these conjunctions help shape and filter the experiences that writer is describing. More specifically, writers who favor a more coordinate style present the world as a stream of loosely connected events, leaving it up to readers to figure out how those events relate to one another (in some cases, the point may be that there are no connections; only ones that we impose). Writers favoring a more subordinate style, by contrast, play a more active role in interpreting events, making the relationships among them explicit. (*PP* 21)

> While my father and uncles and grandfather watched the storm, my mother herded my brother and me down the stairs where, in a little room at the bottom, my grandmother and aunts and cousins sat quietly in the light of a kerosene lamp, their shadows thrown large on the wall. (Paul Crenshaw)

## Motives Focused on Subject Matter

> Beams of light slipped in through the slats, illuminating sides of goat hanging from hooks on the back wall. Hosts of flies jumped from the meat to us and back again. A man with a cleaver stopped hacking away at a beef carcass long enough to hear Malek order three skewers. The flies landed. He started hacking again. The flies took off. (Ted Conover)

## Motives Focused on Writers

> This white from the Savoie region of France, and particularly the village of Abymes, features a crisp, fresh acidity with notes of peach, strawberry and lime. A touch of chalk and river stones so en the acidity, and the wine ends with a mid-finish. … Some will say to pair this with Thai, and I agree, but I think this is a perfect pairing with mac ’n’ cheese! (http:// winegeeks.com/wines/2309)

> The nose is just about as perfumed as it gets, with lovely rose petals, lilac and lavender. Add to this a mix of fresh red fruits, licorice and a fr[e]sh pine note and you have a soft and easy-going aroma that I could smell for days. The palate is very fresh and minty, with gobs of fresh black raspberries and cherries. So silky and elegant that it is almost Burgundian in feel, but not without chewy tannins and tingly acidity. Long and lush. Cellaring will reward you, but I know that I would have a hard time waiting. (http:// winegeeks.com/wines/1093)

## Motives Focused on Readers

Kenneth Burke:  “Once you grasp the trend of the form, it invites participation regardless of the subject matter”

> A skillful comedian could coax a laugh with tiny indicators such as a vocal tic (Bob Hope's "But I wanna tell ya") or even a slight body shift. Jack E. Leonard used to punctuate jokes by slapping his stomach with his hand. One night, watching him on "The Tonight Show," I noticed that several of his punch lines had been unintelligible, and the audience had actually laughed at nothing but the cue of his hand slap.
>
>These notions stayed with me until they formed an idea that revolutionized my comic direction: What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? ([Steve Martin](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/being-funny-17061140/))
