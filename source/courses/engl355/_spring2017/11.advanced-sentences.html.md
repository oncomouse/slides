## For Thursday

Read through Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper." Using the vocabulary we worked with last week and the stuff we learned today, find two moments in the text where you see something interesting happening with Gilman's sentence construction. As well, does Gilman favor a heavily or minimally modified style? Periodic or loose sentences? Right-, left-, or middle-branching sentences? Do these features change over the course of the story?
