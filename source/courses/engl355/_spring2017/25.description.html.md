## Pure Description

> I placed a jar in Tennessee,  
> And round it was, upon a hill.  
> It made the slovenly wilderness   
> Surround that hill.  
> 
> The wilderness rose up to it,  
> And sprawled around, no longer wild.    
> The jar was round upon the ground   
> And tall and of a port in air.  
> 
> It took dominion everywhere.   
> The jar was gray and bare.  
> It did not give of bird or bush,    
> Like nothing else in Tennessee.
>
> â€” Wallace Stevens, "Anecdote of the Jar"
