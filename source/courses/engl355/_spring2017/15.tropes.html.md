## Master Tropes?

> Most people study metaphor first as a technique of poetry in high school. They learn to distinguish it from the technique of *simile*. According to this plan, simile is a comparison that uses *like* or *as*—“My love is *like* a red, red rose,” as the Scottish poet Robert Burns says—while metaphor is a comparison that omits *like* or *as*: “Love is a rose (but you’d better not pick it),” as the old country song says. A related term, *analogy*, is usually reserved for prose. We might say, for example, “Today let us compare the emotion of love to a rose, sometimes thorny but nevertheless beautiful and sensually pleasant.” (*PP*, 85-6)

## Why Tropes Work

> And in many instances, it makes good sense to use them because they offer writers dependable ways to manage their relationships with readers and subject matter. That is, they facilitate communication by allowing writers to tap into their readers’ understanding of the world. Writers who wish to push beyond the conventional into the realm of creativity, however, look for ways to give a well-worn metaphor a new twist or search for entirely new ways for conceiving things. (*PP*, 88)

## Synecdoche vs Metonymy

>  Consider the way you might represent your relationship to the place you live. If you think synecdochally, you might see yourself as part of the land whose minerals you eat and whose water you drink. But if you think metonymically, you might think of your land primarily as a unit of value that could be reduced to money. Money always works metonymically. It has an arbitrary (or artificially assigned) relationship to the things it is associated with—land, food, goods, whatever. (*PP*, 93)

## Persona Scheme
> One way to get a handle on the rhetoric of irony is to use the approach of the triple persona. The approach is based on our ordinary understanding of pronoun grammar. Rhetorical irony involves creating an inner circle of a first and second persona—“I” and “you.” The idea is to bring “I” and “you” into alignment—to create a plural first persona, a “we”—and then to designate a third persona, “them.” “We” stand against “them,” the oppressors or their accomplices, the outsiders, those who are not “in the know.” (*PP*, 96)

## "I Was Being Ironic"
> How do we know the author is winking when we can’t see him? The short answer is we grasp irony by insights into context and tone. If we know something about Jonathan Swift’s political leanings, we can quickly grasp his intent. Even if we don’t, however, we can pick up his tone by the way he manipulates values. When the “I” of the essay suggests cannibalism as a solution to the problem of hunger and poverty, he violates not only the rules of logic but the root values of human life even as he promotes the entrepreneurial spirit and the values of hard work and ingenuity. Some values always take priority over others. Swift’s irony allows the undeniable value of every human life to take priority over the lesser values promoted by his persona, the proposer. The audience is left to reflect on the way that the values of hard work and productivity often mask exploitive attitudes even when they are not taken to the extremes of “A Modest Proposal.” The hope is that the “we” of the essay endures as a political “we” in public life. (*PP*, 97)

## For Thursday

We are reading Anaïs Nin's "The Houseboat," a story suffused with dream imagery and strange linguistic formations. As you read, identify three moments where she is using the four master tropes we discussed today. Come to class prepared to discuss where you see them being used.
