## Style and/as *kairos*

> The how-to books on style imply that you can revise for readability with no loss of voice; indeed, by meeting the reader’s needs for fluency and speed, you add voice to your writing. But we have our doubts. We have come to think that prose is never absolutely improved by any change. Everything comes at a cost. This outlook can be stated as a general principle, the *law of compensation*, which applies to life in general (see Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essay on the topic), but especially to writing: *With every change, something is lost and something is gained*. (*PP* 59)

## From Voice to Footing (Metaphor)
>But like “voice,” “tone” has its limitations as an analytical tool. Both concepts suggest the spoken voice, the sound of a passage, more than its written qualities…
>
>…Footing is a metaphor derived from the physical act of gaining a stable placement of the feet, but when used to describe social interaction, it covers a range of behaviors—from the actual physical stance speakers take with respect to listeners, to the emotions and attitudes they express, to the social roles, languages, and dialects they adopt. (*PP* 61)

## Physical Footings

> I never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously, or plow through another man’s verbs and adjectives so relentlessly. While he was in the midst of his work, somebody shot at him through the open window, and marred the symmetry of my ear.
>
> “Ah,” said he, “that is that scoundrel Smith, of the *Moral Volcano*—he was due yesterday.” And he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and fired. Smith dropped, shot in the thigh. The shot spoiled Smith’s aim, who was just taking a second chance, and he crippled a stranger. It was me. Merely a finger shot off. (Twain qtd. in *PP* 63)

* "In modular arithmetic, a branch of number theory, a number g is a primitive root modulo n if every number a coprime to n is congruent to a power of g modulo n. That is, for every integer a coprime to n, there is an integer k such that gk ≡ a (mod n). Such k is called the index or discrete logarithm of a to the base g modulo n."
