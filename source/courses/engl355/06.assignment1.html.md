## Analysis Activity

In small groups, read each others' analysis entries and answer the following questions:

1. Does the entry address a particular stylistic feature we have discussed in class? Is the feature identified by name?
1. Does the entry include a specific and direct quote from the text as evidence of this feature? Does the quote match the feature?
1. Does the entry speculate about the motives behind this stylistic choice? Do you believe the explanation?
