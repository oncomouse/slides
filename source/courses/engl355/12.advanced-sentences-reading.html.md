## Topics & Stresses

* Another way to think about sentence elements:
	* .topic[Topic] and .stress[Stress]
* .topic[Topic]
	* first part of a sentence
	* what it is about.
* .stress[Stress]
	* last part of a sentence
	* new information

## .topic[The horse] ran over .stress[to the fence].

## Known-New Contract

* To establish strong *cohesion*, .topic[topic] of previous sentence should refer to or restate .stress[stress] of previous sentence.
* For instance:

> .topic[This chapter] is intended to introduce you to .stress[the important grammatical construct called the known-new contract]. .topic[This construct] creates .stress[cohesion]. .topic[Cohesion] is .stress[the process by which sentences follow one another in a coherent manor]. .topic[This coherence] is guaranteed by the known-new contract because it .stress[stresses the strong link of known information to new information].
>
> .topic[To link information] using the known-new contract, you must determine the .stress[stress, or information in the final position of the sentence].
