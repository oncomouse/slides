## Incident
### Countee Cullen
]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_(For Eric Walrond)_

Once riding in old Baltimore,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-filled, head-filled with glee,  
I saw a Baltimorean  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep looking straight at me.

Now I was eight and very small,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was no whit bigger,  
And so I smiled, but he poked out  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tongue, and called me, “Nigger.”

I saw the whole of Baltimore  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From May until December;  
Of all the things that happened there  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s all that I remember.

## Yet Do I Marvel
### Countee Cullen
]

I doubt not God is good, well-meaning, kind,  
And did He stoop to quibble could tell why  
The little buried mole continues blind,  
Why flesh that mirrors Him must some day die,  
Make plain the reason tortured Tantalus  
Is baited by the fickle fruit, declare  
If merely brute caprice dooms Sisyphus  
To struggle up a never-ending stair.  
Inscrutable His ways are, and immune  
To catechism by a mind too strewn  
With petty cares to slightly understand  
What awful brain compels His awful hand.  
Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:  
To make a poet black, and bid him sing!

## The Negro Speaks of Rivers
### Langston Hughes
]

I've known rivers:  
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow of human blood in human veins.  

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.  
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.  
I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.  
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

I've known rivers:  
Ancient, dusky rivers.  

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

## A Dream Deferred
### Langston Hughes
]

.center[
What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up  
like a raisin in the sun?  
Or fester like a sore–  
And then run?  
Does it stink like rotten meat?  
Or crust and sugar over–  
like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags  
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?

## The Weary Blues
### Langston Hughes
]

.weary-blues[
Droning a drowsy [syncopated](http://www.oed.com.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/view/Entry/196416?redirectedFrom=syncopation#eid) tune,  
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard a Negro play.  
Down on [Lenox Avenue](http://www.longwharf.org/sites/default/files/u3/Cotton%20Club.jpg) the other night  
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a lazy sway. . . .  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did a lazy sway. . . .  
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.  
With his ebony hands on each ivory key  
He made that poor piano moan with melody.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Blues!  
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool  
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Blues!  
Coming from a black man’s soul.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Blues!  
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone  
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ain’t got nobody in all this world,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ain’t got nobody but ma self.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put ma troubles on the shelf.”

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.  
He played a few chords then he sang some more—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I got the Weary Blues  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I can’t be satisfied.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got the Weary Blues  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can’t be satisfied—  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ain’t happy no mo’  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wish that I had died.”  
And far into the night he crooned that tune.  
The stars went out and so did the moon.  
The singer stopped playing and went to bed  
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.  
He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.
