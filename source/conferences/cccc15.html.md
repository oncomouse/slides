> English was born about 100 years ago. Its mother, the eldest daughter of Rhetoric, was Oratory-or what we now prefer to call public speaking or, simply, speech. Its father was Philology or what we now call linguistics. Their marriage, as I have suggested, was shortlived, and **English is therefore the child of a broken home**. This unhappy fact accounts, perhaps, for its early feeling of independence and its later bitterness toward both parents.

> Fighting that literature faction often makes you feel like you have invaded China. You can mount an all-out assault and think you're making an impression, but when the smoke clears, nothing has changed. The mandarins are untouched.

> — Hairston, "Breaking Our Bonds and Reaffirming Our Connections"

> Hairston then situates our discipline in a familial context when she write that our problems "originate close to home," in English departments (273). Isn't one of the first moves a successful coup d'état to kill the poets? **What did Harold Bloom say about killing the Father?**

> But before we compromise too much, I think we need to look at that culture as it is today and decide  how strongly we still believe in the values with which we were raised. And I stress "today" because I think that in many ways the culture of English studies has changed significantly in the last ten years. In my department, at least, and in many of those I hear about from my colleagues, **the commitment to literature itself and to teaching students to enjoy literature that made most of us join this profession seems to have faded and to have been replaced by a commitment to criticism for its own sake**.

> ... even now Hairstonian separatism would entail a wasteful duplication of efforts and the weakening of both parties to the divorce. Duelists in insult both suffer from the combat. In a sane academy (and the possibility of oxymoron must be admitted), the teaching of writing in the English language would belong in English departments, **but in English departments compelled to acknowledge that their proper function is indeed higher education in two of the three Rs.**

> Many of these research programs are associated with the digital humanities, which we understand inclusively as projects aiming to digitize historical information through virtual and augmented reality; text analytics intended to analyze corpora too vast to be read in their entirety ("big data" projects); and theoretical inquiries into the nature, effects, and specificities of different media.

> What I would like to propose is an ecological model of writing, whose fundamental tenet is that writing is an activity through which a person is continually engaged with a variety of socially constituted systems.
>
> In contrast, an ecology of writing encompasses much more than the individual writer and her immediate context. An ecologist explores how writers interact to form systems: all the characteristics of any individual writer or piece of writing both determine and are determined by the characteristics of all the other writers and writings in the systems.
