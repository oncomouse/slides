## Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek<br><small>"#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO"</small>

> We need to revive the argument that was traditionally made for post-capitalism: not only is capitalism an unjust and perverted system, but it is also a system that holds back progress. Our technological development is being suppressed by capitalism, as much as it has been unleashed. Accelerationism is the basic belief that these capacities can and should be let loose by moving beyond the limitations imposed by capitalist society. The movement towards a surpassing of our current constraints must include more than simply a struggle for a more rational global society. We believe it must also include recovering the dreams which transfixed many from the middle of the Nineteenth Century until the dawn of the neoliberal era, of the quest of Homo Sapiens towards expansion beyond the limitations of the earth and our immediate bodily forms. These visions are today viewed as relics of a more innocent moment. Yet they both diagnose the staggering lack of imagination in our own time, and offer the promise of a future that is affectively invigorating, as well as intellectually energising. (361)

## Eugene Thacker<br><small>*Cosmic Pessimism*</small>

> Both moral and metaphysical pessimism point to another kind, a pessimism that is neither subjective nor objective, neither for-us nor in-itself, and instead a pessimism of the world-without-us. We could call this a cosmic pessimism ... but this sounds too majestic, too full of wonder, too much the bitter aftertaste of the Great Beyond. Words falter. And so do ideas. And so we have a cosmic pessimism, a pessimism that is first and last a pessimism about cosmos, about the necessity and possibility of order. The contours of cosmic pessimism are a drastic scaling-up or scaling-down of the human point of view, the unhuman orientation of deep space and deep time, and all of this shadowed by an impasse, a primordial insignificance, the impossibility of ever adequately accounting for one’s relationship to thought… (12-3)

## Robert Heinlein<br><small>(in Boucher's *Rocket to the Morgue*)</small>

> There's just one point about rockets I'd like to venture on my own before we start the demonstration.  I don't know if Hugo agrees with me on this; he probably hasn't even bothered himself about it.  But it's this: That the rocket carries in its zooming path the hopes of all men of good will.  **By leaving the planet, man may become worthy of his dominion over it, and attain dominion over himself.**  The realization that there is something beyond this earth, if only a purely physical sense, may unite this earth, may change men form a horde of wretchedly warring clans to a noble union of mankind.
>
> I may be deluded in my hopes. The discovery of new worlds may be as futile as the discovery of the New World.  It may mean only further imperial wars of conquest, new chapters in the cruel exploitation of subject native races.  But it may mean new unity, new vigor, new humanity, and the realization at last of all that is best in mankind.  I hope so anyway. (192)

## H.P. Lovecraft<br><small>"The Call of Cthulhu"</small>

> The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

> Theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents. They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. (167)

## Sam Kriss <br><small>"Manifesto of the Committee to Abolish Outer Space"</small>

> What will Mars look like in ten years, fifty, a hundred, five hundred? It’s a question that breeds monsters. Maybe domed cities, maybe tidy spa resorts on the shores of the Hellas basin. Or there could be dark and vast robots there, colossi wreathed in smoke and fire striding across the planet’s surface, digging deep scars into the rock with metal jaws, stripping out the useful minerals and burning the rest in an atomic blaze. We might see the streaming furrows of a dust storm on the horizon, while the last colonist gnaws at the bones of her fellow adventurers, driven mad by that tiny dot in the night sky that was once her home. The whole thing might have been blasted into fragments and melted down for slag. Still, the worst outcome might be for Mars to end up looking like the area around Clear Lake, south of Houston, the site of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, where our planet faintly touches the blank idiocy of outer space.

## Sam Kriss on Colonialism

> Only in the final chapters [of Robert Zurbin's *The Case for Mars*] does something like a reason why we should want to go to Mars emerge: Space colonization should be read as an exact analogue to Christopher Columbus’s pillage of the Americas. (Columbus is mentioned four times in the book, Marx only once; this is always a bad sign.) By opening up the Americas to settlement, Columbus created something new and unique called “Western humanist civilization.” Out of stifling feudal ignorance grew a society in which “human life and human rights are held precious beyond price,” a world of restless dynamism where scientific innovation is upheld and every effort is made to improve the quality of life for all.

## Sam Kriss on Colonialism

> By the end of the 15th century, feudalism was dying, while workers, peasants and artisans had higher wages and a higher standard of living than ever before. In response the ruling classes, unable to extract enough of a surplus from the restive peasants to reproduce their society, conquered the Americas.
>
> The vast quantities of precious metals shipped back over the Atlantic were a means of social repression. They overturned the economy, leading to massive inflation, skyrocketing grain prices, a collapse in real wages that wasn’t recovered until the 19th century, an enclosure of common property that has still never been reclaimed, and formed the seed of what would become industrial capitalism. The opening of the American frontier wasn’t an opening onto the future but a foreclosing of it, a desperate attempt to save the ruling class that has prevented any significant reorganization of society, prevented any future, right up until the present.

## Laboria Cuboniks<br><small>"Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation"</small>

> The excess of modesty in feminist agendas of recent decades is not  proportionate to the monstrous complexity of our reality, a reality  crosshatched with fibre-optic cables, radio and microwaves, oil and gas  pipelines, aerial and shipping routes, and the unrelenting, simultaneous  execution of millions of communication protocols with every passing  millisecond.  Systematic thinking and structural analysis have largely fallen  by the wayside in favour of admirable, but insufficient struggles, bound to  fixed localities and fragmented insurrections.  Whilst capitalism is  understood as a complex and ever-expanding totality, many would-be emancipatory anti-capitalist projects remain profoundly fearful of transitioning to the universal, resisting big-picture speculative politics by condemning them as necessarily oppressive vectors.  Such a false guarantee treats universals as absolute, generating a debilitating disjuncture between the thing we seek to depose and the strategies we advance to depose it. (0x05)
