1. We can control systems that don’t have any graphical environment installed, including
remote servers, virtual machines, and containers like Docker.
1. Programs executed on the command line can be combined so that the output of one program can be the input of another.
1. Task automation is built-in thanks to the scripting nature of many shells. No more doing repetitive tasks manually.
1. There is a low barrier to creating our own CLI applications. Many utilities for programmers exist only as command-line programs.
