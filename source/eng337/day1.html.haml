		%li.fragment.highlight-blue The Great American Novel?
		%li.fragment.highlight-blue Lacking (Traditional|European) History
		%li.fragment.highlight-blue Enlightenment Nation / Enlightenment Form
	%aside.notes
		:markdown
			1. **The Great American**
				- Probably heard this before?
				- What do you think it means?
				- Can you think of some examples?
					- _Moby Dick_
					- _The Great Gatsby_
			2. **Lacking (Traditional|European) History**
				* Famous joke: England has houses older than our country.
				* But what does that mean? We don't have an appeal to an unbroken tradition tracing back to Rome or Greece or Vikings.
				* America is a nation cobbled together out of immigrants in an unfamiliar (to Europeans).
				* This, of course, denies / ignores the Native traditions in this country pre-colonization, but ...
				* ... that's sort of the point: while trying to write a universal myth of America, often very white, male oriented.
			3. **Enlightenment Nation / Enlightenment Form**
				* Despite all that baggage, America is also a nation created during and from Enlightenment principles
				* Enlightenment:
					* Democracy
					* B/c all humans are created equal with reason.
				* The novel, with it's focus on interiority enforces this idea.
				* Older literary forms (the epic, the play, parents reading _The Bible_ out loud at home) are all oral.
				* Novel is a silent form. Meant to transmit author's rationality to reader's rationality.
				* So, in a sense, novel is natural for America's myth-making.

			1. One-line emails are typically signs that you are not explaining yourself or are being impolite. one-line emails are only appropriate if we have been exchanging many emails about one specific topic and have reached the end of our correspondence about that topic. Above all, remember that politeness is the best way to get what you want from anyone.
			
			Two other things to note:
			
			* Computer problems don't count as an excuse for late work. 
			* Do communicate if you have any health emergencies as soon as they happen.
