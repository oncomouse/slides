	> In one draft of the scene, after hearing Reverend Barbee's guilt-inflicting sermon, the narrator seeks out Woodridge in a desperate attempt to make sense of the mess that his drive with Norton has created. He finds the literature professor drinking whiskey in his beautifully decorated room and wearing a woman's stocking over his head to maintain his hairstyle. Woodridge alludes repeatedly to rumors of his homosexuality and teases his young student for having the courage to visit him in his room. Sidestepping the narrator's dilemma relating to Mr. Norton, Woodridge dwells on his sexuality asserting that even if the rumors are true it should not surprise anyone if they accept sociological claims labeling the Negro the lady of the races. Falling into a rage he advises the narrator to "forget the books literature, oratory" because in the reality of their society such niceties mean nothing. After exhausting himself with a profanity-laced tirade, Woodridge describes a recurring dream in which he gouges out the eyes of his students who obliviously allow to execute his gruesome task. As he drops the bleeding eyeballs into a cotton sack chained around his neck, he wishes that at least one of them would feel the pain. By way of explaining his nightmare, he drunkenly declares the protagonist's willful belief in surface meanings a recipe for living without feeling. He then orders his baffled student to leave his rooms.

	>"I wipe my ass with this literature, this condom to abort reality! This dirty shuck literature they drop to soil our hearts and minds. I mean it," he shouted as he turned suddenly to the bookshelf and I could hear a ripping sound as he turned, seized a book from the shelf and ripped out its pages, scattering them about before my shocked eyes.

	> In this quest, for such it soon became, I learned that nothing could go unchallenged; especially that feverish industry dedicated to telling Negroes who and what they are, and which can usually be counted upon to deprive both humanity and culture of their complexity. I had undergone, not too many months before taking the path which led to writing, the humiliation of being taught in a class in sociology at a Negro college (from Park and Burgess, the leading textbook in the field) that Negroes represented the "lady of the races." This contention the Negro instructor passed blandly along to us without even bothering to wash his hands, much less his teeth.

	> Everywhere and always it [the Negro's racial temperament] has been interested rather in expression than in action; interested in life itself rather than in its reconstruction or reformation. The Negro is, by natural disposition, neither an intellectual nor an idealist, like the Jew; nor a brooding introspective, like the East Indian; nor a pioneer and frontiersman, like the Anglo-Saxon. He is primarily an artist, loving life for its own sake. His metier is expression rather than action. He is, so to speak, the _lady_ among the races.

	> [Irving] Howe accused James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison of abandoning the task of the Negro writer. That task Howe proposed to the militant assertion of Negro freedom. In his assault upon Baldwin and Ellison, Howe evoked Richard Wright as the embodiment of the truest, most relevant exponent of black freedom in fiction. Howe, the knowing white boy, praised Wright for his penchant toward what is termed "protest" literature and castigated both Ellison and Baldwin for their failure to carry on the "protest" tradition as exemplified by Wright's _Native Son_.

	> One unfamiliar with what How stands for would get the impression that when he looks at a Negro he sees not a human being but an abstract embodiment of living hell. He seems never to have considered that American Negro life (and here he is encouraged by certain Negro "spokesmen") is, for the Negro who must live it, not only a burden (and not always that) but also a _discipline_—just as any human life which has endured so long is a discipline teaching its own insights into the human condition, its own strategies of survival.

	> Yet if the only form of tradition, of handing down, consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes, “tradition” should positively be discouraged. We have seen many such simple currents soon lost in the sand; and novelty is better than repetition. Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to anyone who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year; and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence;

	> Which brings me to the most distressing aspect of Howe's thinking: his Northern white liberal version of the white Southern myth of absolute separation of the races. He implies that Negroes can only aspire to contest other Negroes (this at a time when Baldwin has been taking on just about everyone, including Hemingway, Faulkner, and the United States Attorney General!), and must wait for the appearance of a Black Hope before they have the courage to move. How is so committed to a sociological vision of society that he apparently cannot see ... that whatever the efficiency of segregation as a socio-political arrangement, it has been far from absolute on the level of _culture_.

	> Our  lives, since slavery, have been described mainly  in terms of our political, economic, and social  conditions as measured by outside norms, seldom in terms of our own sense of life or our own  sense of values gained from our own unique  American experience.

	> Leaving him and going out into the paint-fuming air I had the feeling that I had been talking beyond myself, had used words and expressed attitudes not my own, that I was in the grip of some alien personality lodged deep within me. Like the servant about whom I'd read in psychology class who, during a trance, had recited pages of Greek philosophy which she had overheard one day while she worked. It was as though I were acting out a scene from some crazy movie. Or perhaps I was catching up with myself and had put into words feelings which I had hitherto suppressed. Or was it, I thought, starting up the walk, that I was no longer afraid?

	> Negro folklore, evolving within a larger culture  which regarded it as inferior, was an especially  courageous expression. It announced the Negro's  willingness to trust his own experience, his own  sensibilities as to the definition of reality, rather  than allow his masters to define these crucial matters for him.

	> Mine is a warm hole. And remember, a bear retires to his hole for the winter and lives until spring; then he comes strolling out like the Easter chick breaking from its shell. I say all this to assure you that it is incorrect to assume that, because I'm invisible and live in a hole, I am dead. I am neither dead nor in a state of suspended animation. Call me Jack-the-Bear, for I am in a state of hibernation.

	>I was filled with turmoil. Why should he think of that? He pointed to the question, word by word. I laughed, deep, deep inside me, giddy with the delight of self-discovery and the desire to hide it. Somehow I was Buckeye the Rabbit... or had been, when as children we danced and sang barefoot in the dusty streets:

	> "Hey you! Hey you!" I yelled. "Hey!" But it was too late. All my movements seemed too slow, ran together. I felt the wheel resisting and tried vainly to reverse it and tried to let go, and it sticking to my palms and my fingers stiff and sticky, and I turned, running now, seeing the needle on one of the gauges swinging madly, like a beacon gone out of control, and trying to think clearly, my eyes darting here and there through the room of tanks and machines and up the stairs so far away and hearing the clear new note arising while I seemed to run swiftly up an incline and shot forward with sudden acceleration into a wet blast of black emptiness that was somehow a bath of whiteness.

	> It was exhilarating. I no longer had to worry about who saw me or about what was proper. To hell with all that, and as sweet as the yam actually was, it became like nectar with the thought. If only someone who had known me at school or at home would come along and see me now. How shocked they'd be! I'd push them into a side street and smear their faces with the peel. What a group of people we were, I thought. Why, you could cause us the greatest humiliation simply by confronting us with something we liked. Not all of us, but so many. Simply by walking up and shaking a set of chitterlings or a well-boiled hog maw at them during the clear light of day! What consternation it would cause! And I saw myself advancing upon Bledsoe, standing bare of his false humility in the crowded lobby of Men's House, and seeing him there and him seeing me and ignoring me and me enraged and suddenly whipping out a foot or two of chitterlings, raw, uncleaned and dripping sticky circles on the floor as I shake them in his face, shouting:

	> "Bledsoe, you're a shameless chitterling eater! I accuse you of relishing how bowels! Ha! And not only do you eat them, you sneak and eat them in private when you think you're unobserved! You're a sneaking chitterling lover! I accuse you of indulging in a filthy habit, Bledsoe! Lug them out of there, Bledsoe! Lug them out so we can see! I accuse you before the eyes of the world!" And he lugs them out, yards of them, with mustard greens, and racks of pigs' ears, and pork chops and black-eyed peas with dull accusing eyes.

	>This is all very wild and childish, I thought, but to hell with being ashamed of what you liked. No more of that for me. I am what I am! I wolfed down the yam and ran back to the old man and handed him twenty cents, "Give me two more," I said.
